<h3><i>Background</i></h3>
<p>The coming of the Pilgrims and their establishment of the
Plymouth Plantation is one of the great adventures in the American
experience. This book is the earliest published account
of that adventure, a day-by-day journal written in a simple
forceful manner by men who took part in it. The story is familiar<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>&mdash;deceptively
familiar, in that portions of it have undergone
a complex process of transformation and emerge as modern
myths in our national folklore. Still it is a story full of glory, and
of tragedy, which deserves a wider public.</p>
<p>The glory, as usual, exists mostly in retrospect. The Separatists
had already shown the courage of their convictions in defying
both Church and State by worshiping in their own way in
England. They had finally been driven to take refuge in Holland,
the only European nation where they could then enjoy
complete religious tolerance. After twelve years of poverty and
social isolation in Amsterdam and Leyden, the self-styled
&ldquo;Saints&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> sought the New World largely as a land of economic
opportunity where they hoped to start afresh. Similar motives
undoubtedly moved the &ldquo;Strangers,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> the motley group of fellow
travelers who joined the party at Plymouth, England, and
doubled their numbers. The &ldquo;Strangers&rdquo; were loyal to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
Church of England, as were the few indentured servants and
hired men, who soon comprised a dissident faction. They cared
no more for freedom of conscience than did the &ldquo;merchant adventurers,&rdquo;
a joint stock company of about seventy London businessmen
who sponsored the plantation only as a commercial
venture likely to yield high profits.</p>
<p>Some have read the &ldquo;Mayflower Compact&rdquo; as the glorious
cornerstone of American democracy, but it seems hardly revolutionary
in context here where it first appeared in print. The
fact that the Pilgrims enjoyed warm relations with some Indians
is also much to their credit, but it may reflect the charity of the
Indians at least as much as their own benevolence. Still one
cannot belittle the achievement of these simple people. They consistently
showed resourcefulness in coping with new problems,
and courage in the face of danger. The greatest glory of the Pilgrims
may well have been the ardent faith and dogged persistence
which saw them through great tragedy.</p>
<p>Although there is little talk of tragedy in this volume, we
know that more than half of the original party died during the
first year at Plymouth. Considering their primitive living conditions,
it is a wonder that so many did survive the &ldquo;general
sickness&rdquo; while wading to and from the shallop, and working hard
to develop new skills in the harsh and alien environment of a
strenuous New England winter. Another tragedy is only presaged
here, in the white man&rsquo;s facile rationalization of his usurpation
of lands which had long been used by Indians. Within
the span of a single lifetime, the indigenous peoples were dispossessed,
and their way of life did not long survive after the
mutually debilitating &ldquo;King Philip&rsquo;s War.&rdquo; The tragedy and
the glory of Pilgrims and Indians alike emerge in a careful reading
of this journal.</p>
<h3><i>About the Book</i></h3>
<p>Any good book must mean many things to many readers, and
this journal offers more than just reflections of past glories and
intimations of great tragedy. It is a primary source for American
history in that critical period when a beach-head of Anglo
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
culture was established in the New World. In this volume are
the earliest accounts of the &ldquo;Mayflower Compact,&rdquo; the establishment
of a community which has become focal in our national
heritage, the signing of this country&rsquo;s first mutual security pact,
and the famous first Thanksgiving. There is no question of
the book&rsquo;s essential authenticity, and most of it has the flavor of
having been written on the spot at the time.</p>
<p>This sense of immediacy also enhances the value of the journal
as a well written story of true adventure. The protagonists
quietly suppressed an impending mutiny, even before they
landed. While exploring the unknown wastes of Cape Cod, they
conducted archeological excavations before they had a roof
over their heads. They were attacked by Indians, and yet
persisted, built their homes in a foreign land, and soon traveled
freely among the natives. This is high adventure indeed!</p>
<p>Political implications are of some importance too. The passengers
on the <i>Mayflower</i> are famous for their founding of &ldquo;a
civil body politic ... to enact, constitute, and frame such just
and equal laws, ordinances, acts, [and] offices from time to time,
as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general
good of the colony.&rdquo; Within less than a week of their first
conversation with an Indian, the Pilgrims signed an enduring
peace treaty with Massasoit, a leader of the neighboring Wampanoags.
A year later, they enjoyed trading relations and military
alliance with many other Indian groups.</p>
<p>The journal may also be viewed as a valuable ethnographic
document. Although previous sporadic contacts by explorers
and traders had yielded some impressionistic descriptions, the
Pilgrims were the first Europeans to be in close and sustained
contact with the Indians of southern New England. At first
they expected only hostility from the &ldquo;savages,&rdquo; but it was not
long before they found valuable helpers in Squanto and Samoset,
both of whom had learned already some English when they
were kidnapped and sold as slaves by English traders. The Pilgrims
were obliged to work out a modus vivendi with these &ldquo;tall
and proper men&rdquo; whose dress seemed outlandish, whose foods
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
were strange, and whose customs were curious enough to deserve
description. We are indebted to the authors of this journal for
a wealth of information about such patterns during the brief
period before they disappeared forever. There are many aspects
of the native ways of life of which the Pilgrims were unaware,
and others which they treated with only tantalizing brevity, but
a wealth of irreplaceable ethnographic data in this volume
serves to illuminate our fragmentary understanding of coastal
Algonquian cultures.</p>
<p>Just as we can learn much about the Indians from this book,
we can also gain rich insights into the character of the Pilgrims
themselves. Mention of the threat of mutiny explodes the hoary
myth of dedicated unity of purpose among all members of the
party. The bravery of the Pilgrims emerges in bold relief, as does
their readiness to rob the graves of Indians. In light of this text,
their industriousness cannot be doubted. Flashes of humor occur,
and their strong sense of being a &ldquo;chosen people&rdquo; is clearly manifest
in recurrent references to a felicitous &ldquo;divine providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human interest&rdquo; is not lacking either. We can imagine the
chagrin of William Bradford unwittingly caught up in a deer
snare, just as we can sympathize with the consternation created
when a prankish boy fired his father&rsquo;s musket in a ship&rsquo;s cabin
where open kegs of gunpowder lay about. It is easy to feel for
the &ldquo;old [Indian] woman whom we judged to be no less than
a hundred years old&rdquo; who wept because &ldquo;she was deprived of the
comfort of her children in her old age&rdquo; when Capt. Hunt
kidnapped her three sons. And how his playmates must have
envied the boy who was lost on Cape Cod, and was returned by
the Nauset Indians, &ldquo;behung with beads&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Within this brief but diverse book there is also a pervasive
mystery, for no one knows who wrote it. The book has become
known as <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i>, but it is not the unitary effort of
a single man. Five of the ten &ldquo;chapters&rdquo; have bylines, and
Mourt&rsquo;s contribution is almost the briefest of the ten. The
mystery deepens when we confess not knowing much about the
man named Mourt. Perhaps the most fruitful way to approach
<span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
the problem is through a discussion of the several components
of the book.</p>
<p>It opens with a dedicatory letter of transmittal &ldquo;To his much
respected friend....&rdquo; This is a form of profuse and discursive
acknowledgment typical of the time. It seems to have been appended
by an associate of the settlers, whose concern was
&ldquo;... but the recommendation of the relation itself,&rdquo; to a distinguished
member of the &ldquo;merchant adventurers&rdquo; who had sponsored
the <i>Mayflower</i> voyage. The dedication is signed <i>R.G.</i>,
which I assume to be a misprint for the initials of Robert
Cushman. The only member of the party at Plymouth with
initials R.G. was Richard Gardiner, an undistinguished &ldquo;Stranger&rdquo;
who stayed only briefly and took little part in the venture.
The fact that misprints are frequent throughout the rest of the
book suggests the possibility of reference to Cushman, who is a
person most likely to have drafted such a letter. As a deacon of
the Leyden congregation who also served as their business agent,
he was instrumental in securing English permission for removal
to the New World, and, after having had to turn back on the
unseaworthy <i>Speedwell</i>, he continued negotiations with the
&ldquo;merchant adventurers&rdquo; while the <i>Mayflower</i> sailed on to Plymouth.
Visiting the plantation on the second ship, <i>Fortune</i>, he
delivered the patent which confirmed their legal right to settle
there, together with a stringent contract from the sponsors,
which he finally induced the Pilgrims to sign, after preaching
a pointed sermon on &ldquo;The Dangers of Self-Love.&rdquo; The manuscript
of the relations must have been carried back to England
with him on the <i>Fortune</i> in December of 1621.</p>
<p>Appended at the end of the volume is another chapter which
I attribute to Cushman. A long exposition of &ldquo;Reasons and
considerations touching the lawfulness of removing out of England
into the parts of America,&rdquo; signed <i>R.C.</i>, is a thinly veiled
promotional tract organized like a sermon, which cites Scripture
to justify the plantation and to persuade others to follow.</p>
<p>Among the prefatory letters is one containing &ldquo;Certain useful
advertisements ...&rdquo; and signed <i>I.R.</i>. We are told that this letter
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
of advice concerning man&rsquo;s proper relation with God and
with his fellow men was &ldquo;... written by a discreet friend unto
the planters in New England, at their first setting sail from
Southampton.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> This &ldquo;unfeigned well-willer&rdquo; is most likely
John Robinson, pastor of the expatriate Separatist congregation
in Leyden, and hence understandably solicitous for the welfare
of the Pilgrims, and also in a position to proffer such counsel. The
letter may have been appended to this book especially to serve as
a model of morality for those &ldquo;Strangers&rdquo; who might hopefully be
induced to emigrate and join the party at Plymouth.</p>
<p>Five &ldquo;relations&rdquo; constitute the major portion of the book,
and none of these is signed. The first and longest, on &ldquo;The
proceedings of the plantation ...,&rdquo; begins with the departure
from Plymouth, England, and recounts events of the next six
months, including the voyage, the signing of the &ldquo;compact,&rdquo;
the several &ldquo;discoveries,&rdquo; the choice of a site and the building
there, as well as early contacts with the Indians, culminating
in the signing of a peace treaty with Massasoit. A second deals
with &ldquo;A journey to Pokanoket ...&rdquo; and describes further friendly
dealings with the Wampanoag Indians. The next treats &ldquo;A
voyage ... to the Kingdom of Nauset, to seek a boy that had
lost himself in the woods....&rdquo; An account of &ldquo;A journey to
Nemasket ...&rdquo; shows how the Pilgrims sought to defend their
Indian allies against the hostile Narragansets, and &ldquo;A relation
of our voyage to the Massachusets ...&rdquo; describes the expansion
of trade relations to the north.</p>
<p>According to the dedicatory letter, these vivid reports were
&ldquo;... writ by the several actors themselves, after their plain and
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
rude manner.&rdquo; It is almost certain that the principal author
was Edward Winslow, although it is generally believed that
William Bradford also had a hand in the effort. Both of these
men were among the few who were prominent in the affairs
of the plantation, and they two are the only ones of the first
party who obviously enjoyed writing. Winslow&rsquo;s <i>Good News
from New England</i> (London, 1624), continued the narrative
of the plantation from the time when this volume left off, and
is markedly similar in style. In his <i>Good News</i> ..., Winslow
mentions descriptions of aspects of Indian culture which were
prepared by &ldquo;... myself and others, in former letters, (which
came to the press against my will and knowledge) ...&rdquo;; I know
of no publication other than <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i> to which this
could refer. Bradford&rsquo;s manuscript history <i>Of Plymouth Plantation</i>
(first published in Boston, 1856) has become the principal
source on the Pilgrim experience, although he could hardly be
said to claim priority when he &ldquo;... first began these scribbled
writings (which was about the year 1630 and so pieced up at
times of leisure afterward).&rdquo; His treatment of the first year at
Plymouth is a curious combination, consisting largely of passages
identical with those in <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i>, together with
discursive classical allusions and philosophic ruminations. Bradford&rsquo;s
style generally tends to be more analytic than descriptive,
and the specificity of detail which makes this text such a rich
source material for the historian and ethnographer rarely occurs
elsewhere in Bradford&rsquo;s work. It is entirely within the
realm of possibility that he may have incorporated in his manuscript
the work of others as it had appeared in <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i>;
he freely adopted material from other sources.</p>
<p>The ensuing &ldquo;Letter sent from New England ... setting
forth ... the worth of that plantation ...,&rdquo; follows the five
narrative relations closely in style, and is signed by <i>E.W.</i>. It
is almost certainly Winslow who here sounds vaguely like a
twentieth-century Florida real estate agent when he describes
the first Thanksgiving as indicating the richness of the land:
&ldquo;I never in my life remember a more seasonable year than we
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
have here enjoyed and if we have once but kine, horses, and sheep,
I make no question but men might live as contented here as in
any part of the world.&rdquo; He also includes some very specific suggestions
concerning the practical needs of those who might
choose to come.</p>
<p>And what was Mourt&rsquo;s contribution to the book which has
been linked with his name by historians, librarians, and bibliographers
since Prince<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> first invented the convenient title,
<i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i>, as a substitute for the cumbersome original?
A brief foreword, or introduction, &ldquo;To the reader,&rdquo; is all that
we must credit to the signer, one <i>G. Mourt</i>. It may have been
he who was responsible for bringing to press this collection of
papers, &ldquo;... hoping of a cheerful proceeding, both of adventurers
and planters.&rdquo; He explicitly denied authorship of the
narratives: &ldquo;These relations coming to my hand from my both
known and faithful friends, on whose writings I do much rely,
I thought it not amiss to make them more general....&rdquo; But
scholars still do not know who he was!</p>
<p>It is suggested that he had at some time been associated with
the authors of the relations, whom he called &ldquo;my both known
and faithful friends.&rdquo; It is also suggested that he had long hoped
to emigrate to the New World, &ldquo;... as myself then much desired,
and shortly hope to effect, if the Lord will, the putting to
of my shoulder in this hopeful business.&rdquo; These criteria clearly
apply to Robert Cushman, who, as we have seen, was a person
who might appropriately have introduced such a book.</p>
<p>The specifications also apply to another member of the Leyden
congregation who was active in negotiating with the &ldquo;merchant
adventurers&rdquo; until he did sail to Plymouth, on the first ship
bound for the plantation after the book was printed. If no
more than the initials had been given in the signature to the
introduction&mdash;as was the case in every other portion of the volume&mdash;there
would be little hesitation to identify the author as
George Morton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</div>
<p>As it is, however, one must attempt to account for the discrepancy
in name if he suggests that it may have been Morton
who wrote it. It is easy to suggest that the use of &ldquo;Mourt&rdquo; for
&ldquo;Morton&rdquo; could have been merely another of the many misprints
in the book. At least as plausible, however, is the suggestion
that it may have been a pseudonym. It is not difficult to
imagine why there might have been some attempt to conceal
the fact <i>if</i> Morton had been intimately involved in the preparation
and promulgation of the book. A printer might have been
reluctant to &ldquo;publish&rdquo; a document written by Separatists unless
it carried an introduction by an apparently disinterested party.
In a period of strict royal control of the press in England, William
Brewster of the Leyden congregation had already incurred the
wrath of King James by printing an outspoken opposition tract,
<i>Perth Assembly</i> (Leyden, 1619), so that any writings by his friends
and associates might logically also be suspect. Furthermore, the
fact that <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i> is essentially a promotional effort is
clearly implied in the phrasing of the original title, describing the
&ldquo;safe arrival&rdquo; of the &ldquo;English planters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;their joyful building
of, and comfortable planting themselves in the now well
defended town of New Plymouth.&rdquo; In such an effort to excite
more prospective settlers, it would have been sound public relations
to minimize the degree of identification between the
plantation and the &ldquo;Saints,&rdquo; who were popularly scorned as
heretics and criminals.</p>
<p>Another possibility must be mentioned. I am only half-joking
when I suggest that at least this portion of <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i> may
actually have been written by someone named G. Mourt, of
whom we know nothing else. One of the delights of historical
research is the fact that one always raises more questions than
he can answer. The mystery remains.</p>
<p><i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i> is clearly a book which offers different meanings
to every reader. I hope that this edition may reach a broad
audience and increase popular understanding of a neglected
portion of the American experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</div>
<h3><i>A Note on This Edition</i></h3>
<p>My intention is to provide the contemporary reader with an
appreciation of this exciting book as it was received by an eager
and curious public when it was first published almost three and
a half centuries ago. In keeping with this aim, the entire text
is included here, in the order of the original.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> So that the authors
may speak forcefully and directly to the reader of today,
I have introduced only uniform spelling, punctuation, and
paragraphing, structural niceties which were of no concern to
authors or printers until late in the eighteenth century. The
eloquent English language of the period is familiar to us all,
through the King James version of the Bible or the works of
Shakespeare, and I have scrupulously left each word intact. The
text, then, is reproduced verbatim, including marginalia, chapter
headings, and running heads, altered only by the use of
modern orthography for the sake of clarity.</p>
<p>I have deliberately avoided distracting the reader from the
original text, by introducing a minimum of footnotes. Some annotation
seems indispensable for understanding the work of another
age, but this edition does not bear the tender burden of
scholarly disquisition. Modern equivalents are given for archaic
words and place-names, and I have offered brief explanations of
a few outdated allusions. Dates are retained as in the original,
so that ten days must be added to any date given in the text in
order to fit it into the modern Gregorian calendar, which was
not adopted by England and her colonies until 1752.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</div>
<p>In the exacting task of collating this text with the original, I
was helped by my friend and colleague, Anna Mae Cooper.
We worked in the John Carter Brown Library where Thomas R.
Adams kindly put excellent facilities at our disposal, including
the library&rsquo;s copy of the first edition of the book, as well as the
Smith and Champlain maps. Lucille Hanna first introduced
me to the excitement of history, and J. L. Giddings pointed
out the ethnographic value of <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i>. Miss Rose T.
Briggs, Director of Pilgrim Hall, shared her enthusiasm and
broad knowledge of the Pilgrims. E. Lawrence Couter, David
Freeman, Arthur G. Pyle, Muriel Stefani, and the entire staff of
Plimoth Plantation were helpful in many ways, and the corporation
generously provided the photographs. The title page,
ornamental letters and top-page designs are reproduced from a
copy of the original, now in possession of the Rhode Island
Historical Society. Mrs. N. Mac Donald typed from a difficult
manuscript.</p>
<p>An adventure such as this rightfully belongs to all who would
chase rainbows!</p>

<h3>SAMUEL DE CHAMPLAIN&rsquo;S MAP OF PLYMOUTH HARBOR</h3>
<p>Although the Pilgrims were the first Europeans to establish a
permanent colony in northeastern North America, they did not come
to an unknown land. As early as 1605, Samuel de Champlain had
mapped Plymouth Harbor, in the course of a three-year expedition
during which he explored the coast from Nova Scotia to Martha&rsquo;s
Vineyard. The quality of his detailed and accurate observations
on the land and people appears in this map, and in his notes on
the visit: &ldquo;There came to us two or three canoes, which had just
been fishing for cod and other fish which are found there in large
numbers. These they catch with hooks made of a piece of wood,
to which they attach a bone in the shape of a spear and fasten it
very securely. The whole has a fang-shape, and the line attached
to it is made out of the bark of a tree. They gave me one of their
hooks, which I took out of curiosity. In it the bone was fastened
on by hemp, like that in France, as it seemed to me, and they told
me that they gathered this plant without being obliged to cultivate
it, and indicated that it grew to the height of four or five feet.
This canoe went back on shore to give notice to their fellow inhabitants,
who caused columns of smoke to arise on our account. We
saw eighteen or twenty savages, who came to the shore and began
to dance. Our canoe landed in order to give them some bagatelles,
at which they were greatly pleased. Some of them came to us and
begged us to go to their river. We weighed anchor to do so, but
were unable to enter on account of the small amount of water,
it being low tide, and were accordingly obliged to anchor at the
mouth. I went ashore, where I saw many others, who received us
very cordially. I made also an examination of the river, but saw
only an arm of water extending a short distance inland, where the
land is only in part cleared. Running into this is merely a brook
not deep enough for boats except at full tide. The circuit of the
bay is about a league. On one side of the entrance to this bay
there is a point which is almost an island, covered with wood,
principally pines, and adjoins sandbanks, which are very extensive.
On the other side, the land is high. There are two islets in this
bay, which are not seen until one has entered, and around which
it is almost entirely dry at low tide. This place is very conspicuous
from the sea, for the coast is very low, excepting the cape at the
entrance to the bay. We named it the Port du Cap. St. Louis...&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH&rsquo;S MAP OF NEW ENGLAND</h3>
<p>The Pilgrims were familiar with Capt. John Smith&rsquo;s account
of a voyage in which he had surveyed the coast from Cape Cod
to Penobscot Bay in 1614. He had even offered his services as guide
and military captain, but Myles Standish got the job. Undoubtedly
they did bring with them his <i>Description of New England</i> (London,
1616), in which the following map was published.</p>
<p>Capt. Smith, who had already gained some fame and fortune in
Virginia, dedicated to Prince Charles this effort in which the term
&ldquo;New England&rdquo; first appeared: &ldquo;... it being my chance to range
some other parts of America, whereof I here present your highness
the description in a map, my humble suit [in original, &ldquo;sure&rdquo;]
is you would please to change their barbarous names for such
English, as posterity may say Prince Charles was their godfather.&rdquo;
Several English place-names were incorporated in the map, but
posterity disregarded most of them, a noteworthy exception being
&ldquo;Plimouth.&rdquo; Smith notes that the Indians called the site &ldquo;... Accomack,
an excellent good harbor, good land, and no want of any
thing but industrious people,&rdquo; recalling that &ldquo;After much kindness,
upon a small occasion we fought also with 40 or 50 of those
[Indians]; though some were hurt and some slain, yet within an
hour after, they became friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The map was subsequently reissued in several other works by
Smith, additions being made on the engraved copper plate from
time to time, to indicate more recent discoveries and settlements.
The copy reproduced here is from a first edition, now in possession
of the John Carter Brown Library; obviously the representations
of European-style buildings were as inappropriate as were the illustrations
of monsters, introduced by imaginatively artistic cartographers.
(The note concerning Smith&rsquo;s death was written in ink
by a previous owner of this copy.)</p>

<p>Good Friend:</p>
<p>As we cannot but account it
an extraordinary blessing of
God in directing our course for
these parts, after we came out of our native
country, for that we had the happiness to
be possessed of the comforts we receive by
the benefit of one of the most pleasant,
most healthful, and most fruitful parts of
the world; so must we acknowledge the
same blessing to be multiplied upon our
whole company, for that we obtained the
honor to receive allowance and approbation
of our free possession and enjoying
thereof, under the authority of those thrice
honored persons, the President and
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
Council for the Affairs of New England,
by whose bounty and grace, in that behalf,
all of us are tied to dedicate our best service
unto them,<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a> as those under his Majesty,
that we owe it unto, whose noble endeavors
in these their actions the God of heaven
and earth multiply to his glory and their
own eternal comforts.</p>
<p>As for this poor relation, I pray you to
accept it, as being writ by the several actors
themselves, after their plain and rude
manner; therefore doubt nothing of the
truth thereof. If it be defective in any
thing, it is their ignorance, that are better
acquainted with planting than writing. If
it satisfy those that are well affected to the
business, it is all I care for. Sure I am the
place we are in, and the hopes that are
apparent, cannot but suffice any that will
not desire more than enough. Neither is
there want of aught among us but company
to enjoy the blessings so plentifully bestowed
upon the inhabitants that are here.
While I was a-writing this, I had almost
forgot that I had but the recommendation
of the relation itself to your further consideration,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
and therefore I will end without
saying more, save that I shall always rest</p>

<p><i>Courteous Reader, be entreated to make
a favorable construction of my forwardness
in publishing these ensuing
discourses. The desire of carrying the Gospel
of Christ into those foreign parts, amongst those
people that as yet have had no knowledge nor
taste of God, as also to procure unto themselves
and others a quiet and comfortable habitation,
were, amongst other things, the inducements
(unto these undertakings of the then hopeful,
and now experimentally known good enterprise
for plantation in New England) to set afoot
and prosecute the same. And though it fared
with them, as it is common to the most actions
of this nature, that the first attempts prove
difficult, as the sequel more at large expresseth,
yet it hath pleased God, even beyond our expectation
in so short a time, to give hope of
letting some of them see (though some he hath
taken out of this vale of tears)<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> some grounds
of hope of the accomplishment of both those
ends by them at first propounded.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>

in the meantime, these relations coming to my
hand from my both known and faithful

thought it not amiss to make them more general,
hoping of a cheerful proceeding, both of adventurers
and planters, entreating that the example
of the honorable Virginia and Bermudas
Companies, encountering with so many disasters,
and that for divers years together, with an
unwearied resolution, the good effects whereof
are now eminent, may prevail as a spur of preparation
also touching this no less hopeful country,

<p>Loving and Christian friends. I do
heartily and in the Lord salute you all,
as being they with whom I am present
in my best affection, and most earnest
longings after you, though I be constrained
for a while to be bodily absent from you; I
say constrained, God knowing how willingly and
much rather than otherwise I would have borne my
part with you in this first brunt, were I not by strong
necessity held back for the present. Make account
of me in the meanwhile, as of a man divided in
myself with great pain, and as (natural bonds set
aside) having my better part with you.</p>
<p>And though I doubt not but in your godly wisdoms
you both foresee and resolve upon that which concerneth
your present state and condition, both
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
severally and jointly, yet have I thought but my
duty to add some further spur of provocation unto
them who run already, if not because you need it,
yet because I owe it in love and duty.</p>
<p>And first, as we are daily to renew our repentance
with our God, special for our sins known, and
general for our unknown trespasses, so doth the
Lord call us in a singular manner upon occasions of
such difficulty and danger as lieth upon you, to a
both more narrow search and careful reformation of
our ways in his sight, lest he, calling to remembrance
our sins forgotten by us or unrepented of, take
advantage against us, and in judgment leave us for
the same to be swallowed up in one danger or other;
whereas on the contrary, sin being taken away by
earnest repentance and pardon thereof from the
Lord, sealed up unto a man&rsquo;s conscience by his Spirit,
great shall be his security and peace in all dangers,
sweet his comforts in all distresses, with happy deliverance
from all evil, whether in life or in death.</p>
<p>Now next after this heavenly peace with God and
our own consciences, we are carefully to provide for
peace with all men what in us lieth, especially with
our associates, and for that end watchfulness must
be had, that we neither at all in ourselves do give,
no, nor easily take offense being given by others.
Woe be unto the world for offenses, for though it
be necessary (considering the malice of Satan and
man&rsquo;s corruption) that offenses come, yet woe unto
the man or woman either by whom the offense
cometh, saith Christ, Matt. 18:7. And if offenses
in the unseasonable use of things in themselves indifferent,
be more to be feared than death itself, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
the Apostle teacheth, 1 Cor. 9:15, how much more
in things simply evil, in which neither honor of God,
nor love of man is thought worthy to be regarded.</p>
<p>Neither yet is it sufficient that we keep ourselves
by the grace of God from giving offense, except
withal we be armed against the taking of them when
they are given by others. For how unperfect and
lame is the work of grace in that person, who
wants charity to cover a multitude of offenses, as
the Scriptures speak. Neither are you to be exhorted
to this grace only upon the common grounds of
Christianity, which are, that persons ready to take
offense, either want charity to cover offenses, or
wisdom duly to weigh human fraility; or lastly are
gross, though close hypocrites, as Christ our Lord
teacheth, Matt. 7:1,2,3, as indeed in mine own experience,
few or none have been found which sooner
give offense, than such as easily take it; neither have
they ever proved sound and profitable members in
societies, which have nourished in themselves that
touchy humor.</p>
<p>But besides these, there are divers special motives
provoking you above others to great care and conscience
this way: as first, you are many of you
strangers, as to the persons, so to the infirmities one
of another, and so stand in need of more watchfulness
this way, lest when such things fall out in men
and women as you suspected not, you be inordinately
affected with them, which doth require at your hands
much wisdom and charity for the covering and preventing
of incident offenses that way. And lastly
your intended course of civil community will minister
continual occasion of offense, and will be as fuel for
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
that fire, except you diligently quench it with
brotherly forbearance. And if taking offense causelessly
or easily at men&rsquo;s doings be so carefully to be
avoided, how much more heed is to be taken that we
take not offense at God himself, which yet we
certainly do so oft as we do murmur at his providence
in our crosses, or bear impatiently such afflictions as
wherewith he pleaseth to visit us. Store we up therefore
patience against the evil day, without which
we take offense at the Lord himself in his holy and
just works.</p>
<p>A fourth thing there is carefully to be provided
for, to wit, that with your common employments
you join common affections truly bent upon the
general good, avoiding as a deadly plague of your
both common and special comfort all retiredness of
mind for proper advantage, and all singularly
affected any manner of way; let every man repress
in himself and the whole body in each person, as so
many rebels against the common good, all private
respects of men&rsquo;s selves, not sorting with the general
conveniency. And as men are careful not to have a
new house shaken with any violence before it be
well settled and the parts firmly knit, so be you, I
beseech you brethren, much more careful, that the
house of God which you are and are to be, be not
shaken with unnecessary novelties or other oppositions
at the first settling thereof.</p>
<p>Lastly, whereas you are to become a body politic,
using amongst yourselves civil government, and are
not furnished with any persons of special eminency
above the rest, to be chosen by you into office of
government, let your wisdom and godliness appear
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
not only in choosing such persons as do entirely love,
and will diligently promote the common good, but
also in yielding unto them all due honor and obedience
in their lawful administrations, not beholding
in them the ordinariness of their persons, but God&rsquo;s
ordinance for your good, nor being like unto the
foolish multitude, who more honor the gay coat
than either the virtuous mind of the man or glorious
ordinance of the Lord. But you know better things,
and that the image of the Lord&rsquo;s power and authority
which the Magistrate beareth is honorable, in how
mean persons soever. And this duty you both may
the more willingly, and ought the more conscionably
to perform, because you are at least for the present
to have only them for your ordinary governors
which yourselves shall make choice of for that work.</p>
<p>Sundry other things of importance I could put you
in mind of, and of those before mentioned in more
words, but I will not so far wrong your godly minds
as to think you heedless of these things, there being
also divers among you so well able to admonish
both themselves and others of what concerneth them.</p>
<p>These few things therefore, and the same in few
words I do earnestly commend unto your care and
conscience, joining therewith my daily incessant
prayers unto the Lord, that he who hath made the
heavens and the earth, the sea and all rivers of
waters, and whose providence is over all his works,
especially over all his dear children for good, would
so guide and guard you in your ways, as inwardly by
his Spirit, so outwardly by the hand of his power, as
that both you and we also, for and with you, may
have after matter of praising his name all the days
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
of your and our lives. Fare you well in him in whom
you trust, and in whom I rest</p>

<p>Wednesday, the sixth of September,
the wind coming east-north-east,
a fine small gale,
we loosed from Plymouth,
having been kindly entertained
and courteously used by
divers friends there dwelling,
and after many difficulties in
boisterous storms, at length, by
God&rsquo;s providence, upon the
ninth of November following,
by break of the day we espied land which we deemed to be
Cape Cod, and so afterward it proved. And the appearance
of it much comforted us, especially seeing so goodly a land,
and wooded to the brink of the sea. It caused us to rejoice
together, and praise God that had given us once again to
see land. And thus we made our course south-south-west,
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
purposing to go to a river ten leagues to the south of the
Cape,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> but at night the wind being contrary, we put round
again for the bay of Cape Cod. And upon the 11th of November
we came to an anchor in the bay,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> which is a good
harbor and pleasant bay, circled round, except in the entrance
which is about four miles over from land to land,
compassed about to the very sea with oaks, pines, juniper,
sassafras, and other sweet wood. It is a harbor wherein a
thousand sail of ships may safely ride. There we relieved
ourselves with wood and water, and refreshed our people,
while our shallop was fitted to coast the bay, to search for
a habitation. There was the greatest store of fowl that
ever we saw.</p>
<p>And every day we saw whales playing hard by us, of
which in that place, if we had instruments and means to
take them, we might have made a very rich return, which
to our great grief we wanted. Our master and his mate,
and others experienced in fishing, professed we might have
made three or four thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of oil. They
preferred it before Greenland whale-fishing, and purpose
the next winter to fish for whale here. For cod we assayed,
but found none; there is good store, no doubt, in their
season. Neither got we any fish all the time we lay there,
but some few little ones on the shore. We found great
mussels, and very fat and full of sea-pearl, but we could
not eat them, for they made us all sick that did eat, as well
sailors as passengers. They caused to cast and scour,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> but
they were soon well again.</p>
<p>The bay is so round and circling that before we could
come to anchor we went round all the points of the compass.
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
We could not come near the shore by three quarters
of an English mile, because of shallow water, which was a
great prejudice to us, for our people going on shore were
forced to wade a bow shot or two in going a land, which
caused many to get colds and coughs, for it was nigh times
freezing cold weather.</p>
<p>This day before we came to harbor, observing some not
well affected to unity and concord, but gave some appearance
of faction,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> it was thought good there should be an
association and agreement that we should combine together
in one body, and to submit to such government and
governors as we should by common consent agree to make
and choose, and set our hands to this that follows word for
word.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>In the name of God, Amen. We whose names are underwritten,
the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign lord
King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France,
and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, etc.</p>
<p>Having undertaken, for the glory of God, and advancement
of the Christian faith, and honor of our king and
country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
parts of Virginia, do by these presents solemnly and mutually
in the presence of God and one of another, covenant,
and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic,
for our better ordering and preservation, and furtherance
of the ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute,
and frame such just and equal laws, ordinances,
acts, constitutions, offices from time to time, as shall be
thought most meet and convenient for the general good of
the colony: unto which we promise all due submission and
obedience. In witness whereof we have hereunder subscribed
our names; Cape Cod, the 11th of November, in
the year of the reign of our sovereign lord King James, of
England, France and Ireland eighteenth and of Scotland
fifty-fourth, Anno Domini 1620.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The same day, so soon as we could we set ashore fifteen
or sixteen men, well armed, with some to fetch wood, for
we had none left; as also to see what the land was, and
what inhabitants they could meet with. They found it to
be a small neck of land, on this side where we lay is the
bay, and the further side the sea; the ground or earth, sand
hills, much like the downs in Holland, but much better;
the crust of the earth a spit&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> depth excellent black earth;
all wooded with oaks, pines, sassafras, juniper, birch, holly,
vines, some ash, walnut; the wood for the most part
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
open and without underwood, fit either to go or ride
in. At night our people returned, but found not any person,
nor habitation, and laded their boat with juniper,
which smelled very sweet and strong and of which we
burnt the most part of the time we lay there.</p>
<p>Monday, the 13th of November, we unshipped our
shallop<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> and drew her on land, to mend and repair her,
having been forced to cut her down in bestowing her betwixt
the decks, and she was much opened with the people&rsquo;s
lying in her,<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a> which kept us long there, for it was sixteen
or seventeen days before the carpenter had finished her.
Our people went on shore to refresh themselves, and our
women to wash, as they had great need. But whilst we
lay thus still, hoping our shallop would be ready in five or
six days at the furthest, but our carpenter made slow work
of it, so that some of our people, impatient of delay, desired
for our better furtherance to travel by land into the
country, which was not without appearance of danger, not
having the shallop with them, nor means to carry provision,
but on their backs, to see whether it might be fit for us to
seat in or no, and the rather because as we sailed into the
harbor there seemed to be a river opening itself into the
main land. The willingness of the persons was liked, but
the thing itself, in regard of the danger, was rather permitted
than approved, and so with cautions, directions, and
instructions, sixteen men were set out with every man his
musket, sword, and corslet, under the conduct of Captain
Miles Standish, unto whom was adjoined, for counsel and
advice, William Bradford, Stephen Hopkins, and Edward
Tilley.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 15th of November, they were set ashore,
and when they had ordered themselves in the order of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
single file and marched about the space of a mile, by the
sea they espied five or six people with a dog, coming towards
them, who were savages, who when they saw them,
ran into the wood and whistled the dog after them, etc.
First they supposed them to be Master Jones, the master,
and some of his men, for they were ashore and knew of
their coming, but after they knew them to be Indians they
marched after them into the woods, lest other of the Indians
should lie in ambush. But when the Indians saw our men
following them, they ran away with might and main and
our men turned out of the wood after them, for it was the
way they intended to go, but they could not come near them.
They followed them that night about ten miles by the trace
of their footings, and saw how they had come the same
way they went, and at a turning perceived how they ran
up a hill, to see whether they followed them. At length
night came upon them, and they were constrained to take
up their lodging, so they set forth three sentinels, and the
rest, some kindled a fire, and others fetched wood, and there
held our rendezvous that night.</p>
<p>In the morning so soon as we could see the trace, we
proceeded on our journey, and had the track until we had
compassed the head of a long creek, and there they took into
another wood, and we after them, supposing to find some
of their dwellings, but we marched through boughs and
bushes, and under hills and valleys, which tore our very
armor in pieces, and yet could meet with none of them,
nor their houses, nor find any fresh water, which we greatly
desired, and stood in need of, for we brought neither
beer nor water with us, and our victuals was only biscuit
and Holland cheese, and a little bottle of aquavitae, so as
we were sore athirst. About ten o&rsquo;clock we came into a
deep valley, full of brush, wood-gaile, and long grass,
through which we found little paths or tracks, and there
we saw a deer, and found springs of fresh water, of which
we were heartily glad, and sat us down and drunk our first
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
New England water with as much delight as ever we drunk
drink in all our lives.</p>
<p>When we had refreshed ourselves, we directed our course
full south, that we might come to the shore, which within
a short while after we did, and there made a fire, that they
in the ship might see where we were (as we had direction)
and so marched on towards this supposed river. And as
we went in another valley we found a fine clear pond of
fresh water, being about a musket shot broad and twice as
long. There grew also many fine vines, and fowl and deer
haunted there; there grew much sassafras.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> From thence we
went on, and found much plain ground, about fifty acres,
fit for the plow, and some signs where the Indians had formerly
planted their corn. After this, some thought it best,
for nearness of the river, to go down and travel on the sea
sands, by which means some of our men were tired, and
lagged behind. So we stayed and gathered them up, and
struck into the land again, where we found a little path
to certain heaps of sand, one whereof was covered with old
mats, and had a wooden thing like a mortar whelmed<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> on
the top of it, and an earthen pot laid in a little hole at the
end thereof. We, musing what it might be, digged and
found a bow, and, as we thought, arrows, but they were
rotten. We supposed there were many other things, but
because we deemed them graves, we put in the bow again
and made it up as it was, and left the rest untouched, because
we thought it would be odious unto them to ransack
their sepulchres.</p>
<p>We went on further and found new stubble, of which
they had gotten corn this year, and many walnut trees full
of nuts, and great store of strawberries, and some vines.
Passing thus a field or two, which were not great, we came
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
to another which had also been new gotten, and there we
found where a house had been, and four or five old planks
laid together; also we found a great kettle which had been
some ship&rsquo;s kettle and brought out of Europe.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> There
was also a heap of sand, made like the former&mdash;but it
was newly done, we might see how they had paddled it
with their hands&mdash;which we digged up, and in it we
found a little old basket full of fair Indian corn, and digged
further and found a fine great new basket full of very fair
corn of this year, with some thirty-six goodly ears of corn,
some yellow, and some red, and others mixed with blue,
which was a very goodly sight. The basket was round,
and narrow at the top; it held about three or four bushels,
which was as much as two of us could lift up from the
ground, and was very handsomely and cunningly made. But
whilst we were busy about these things, we set our men
sentinel in a round ring, all but two or three which digged
up the corn. We were in suspense what to do with it
and the kettle, and at length, after much consultation, we
concluded to take the kettle and as much of the corn as
we could carry away with us; and when our shallop came,
if we could find any of the people, and come to parley with
them, we would give them the kettle again, and satisfy them
for their corn.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> So we took all the ears, and put a good
deal of the loose corn in the kettle for two men to bring
away on a staff; besides, they that could put any into their
pockets filled the same. The rest we buried again, for we
were so laden with armor that we could carry no more.</p>
<p>Not far from this place we found the remainder of an
old fort, or palisade, which as we conceived had been made
by some Christians. This was also hard by that place which
we thought had been a river, unto which we went and found
it so to be, dividing itself into two arms by a high bank.
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Standing right by the cut or mouth which came from the
sea, that which was next unto us was the less; the other
arm was more than twice as big, and not unlike to be a
harbor for ships. But whether it be a fresh river, or only
an indraught of the sea, we had no time to discover, for we
had commandment to be out but two days. Here also we
saw two canoes, the one on the one side, the other on the
other side; we could not believe it was a canoe, till we came
near it. So we returned, leaving the further discovery hereof
to our shallop, and came that night back again to the
fresh water pond, and there we made our rendezvous that
night, making a great fire, and a barricade to windward of
us, and kept good watch with three sentinels all night,
every one standing when his turn came, while five or six
inches of match was burning.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> It proved a very rainy
night.</p>
<p>In the morning we took our kettle and sunk it in the
pond, and trimmed our muskets, for few of them would go
off because of the wet, and so coasted the wood again to
come home, in which we were shrewdly puzzled, and lost
our way. As we wandered we came to a tree, where a
young sprit<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a> was bowed down over a bow, and some acorns
strewed underneath. Stephen Hopkins said it had been to
catch some deer. So as we were looking at it, William
Bradford being in the rear, when he came looked also upon
it, and as he went about, it gave a sudden jerk up, and he
was immediately caught by the leg. It was a very pretty
device, made with a rope of their own making and having a
noose as artificially<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> made as any roper in England can
make, and as like ours as can be, which we brought away
with us. In the end we got out of the wood, and were
fallen about a mile too high above the creek, where we saw
three bucks, but we had rather have had one of them.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a> We
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
also did spring three couple of partridges, and as we came
along by the creek we saw great flocks of wild geese and
ducks, but they were very fearful of us. So we marched
some while in the woods, some while on the sands, and
other while in the water up to the knees, till at length we
came near the ship, and then we shot off our pieces, and
the long boat came to fetch us. Master Jones and Master
Carver being on the shore, with many of our people, came
to meet us. And thus we came both weary and welcome
home, and delivered in our corn into the store, to be kept
for seed, for we knew not how to come by any, and therefore
were very glad, purposing, so soon as we could meet with
any of the inhabitants of that place, to make them large
satisfaction. This was our first discovery, whilst our shallop
was in repairing.</p>
<p>Our people did make things as fitting as they could, and
time would, in seeking out wood, and helving<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> of tools,
and sawing of timber to build a new shallop. But the discommodiousness
of the harbor did much hinder us for we could
neither go to nor come from the shore, but at high water,
which was much to our hindrance and hurt, for oftentimes
they waded to the middle of the thigh, and oft to the knees,
to go and come from land. Some did it necessarily, and
some for their own pleasure, but it brought to the most, if
not to all, coughs and colds, the weather proving suddenly
cold and stormy, which afterwards turned to the scurvy,<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a>
whereof many died.</p>
<p>When our shallop was fit&mdash;indeed, before she was
fully fitted, for there was two days&rsquo; work after bestowed
on her&mdash;there was appointed some twenty-four men of our
own, and armed, then to go and make a more full discovery
of the rivers before mentioned. Master Jones was desirous
to go with us, and we took such of his sailors as he thought
useful for us, so as we were in all about thirty-four men.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
We made Master Jones our leader, for we thought it best
herein to gratify his kindness and forwardness. When we
were set forth, it proved rough weather and cross winds, so
as we were constrained, some in the shallop, and others in
the long boat, to row to the nearest shore the wind would
suffer them to go unto, and then to wade out above the
knees. The wind was so strong as the shallop could not
keep the water, but was forced to harbor there that night,
but we marched six or seven miles further, and appointed
the shallop to come to us as soon as they could. It blowed
and did snow all that day and night, and froze withal; some
of our people that are dead took the original of their death
here.</p>
<p>The next day, about eleven o&rsquo;clock, our shallop came to
us and we shipped ourselves, and the wind being good, we
sailed to the river we formerly discovered, which we named
Cold Harbor, to which when we came we found it not
navigable for ships, yet we thought it might be a good
harbor for boats, for it flows there twelve foot at high water.
We landed our men between the two creeks and marched
some four or five miles by the greater of them, and the
shallop followed us. At length night grew on, and our men
were tired with marching up and down the steep hills and
deep valleys which lay half a foot thick with snow. Master
Jones, wearied with marching, was desirous we should take
up our lodging, though some of us would have marched
further, so we made there our rendezvous for that night,
under a few pine trees. And as it fell out, we got three fat
geese and six ducks to our supper, which we ate with soldiers&rsquo;
stomachs, for we had eaten little all that day. Our
resolution was next morning to go up to the head of this
river, for we supposed it would prove fresh water, but in the
morning our resolution held not, because many liked not
the hilliness of the soil, and badness of the harbor. So we
turned towards the other creek, that we might go over and
look for the rest of the corn that we left behind when we
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
were here before.</p>
<p>When we came to the creek we saw the canoe lie on the
dry ground, and a flock of geese in the river, at which one
made a shot and killed a couple of them, and we launched
the canoe and fetched them and when we had done, she
carried us over by seven or eight at once. This done, we
marched to the place where we had the corn formerly,
which place we called Cornhill, and digged and found the
rest, of which we were very glad. We also digged in a place
a little further off, and found a bottle of oil. We went to
another place which we had seen before, and digged, and
found more corn, viz. two or three baskets full of Indian
wheat,<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> and a bag of beans, with a good many of fair
wheat<a class="fn" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> ears. Whilst some of us were digging up this, some
others found another heap of corn, which they digged up
also, so as we had in all about ten bushels, which will
serve us sufficiently for seed.
<span class="inside">Note.</span>
And sure it was God&rsquo;s good
providence that we found this corn, for else we know not
how we should have done, for we knew not how we should
find or meet with any Indians, except it be to do us a
mischief.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a> Also, we had never in all likelihood seen a grain
of it if we had not made our first journey, for the ground
was now covered with snow, and so hard frozen that we were
fain with our cutlasses and short swords to hew and carve
the ground a foot deep, and then wrest it up with levers,
for we had forgot to bring other tools. Whilst we were in
this employment, foul weather being towards, Master Jones
was earnest to go aboard, but sundry of us desired to make
further discovery and to find out the Indians&rsquo; habitations.
So we sent home with him our weakest people, and some
that were sick, and all the corn, and eighteen of us stayed
still, and lodged there that night, and desired that the shallop
might return to us next day and bring us some mattocks
and spades with them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The next morning we followed certain beaten paths and
tracks of the Indians into the woods, supposing they would
have led us into some town, or houses. After we had gone
a while, we light upon a very broad beaten path, well nigh
two feet broad. Then we lighted all our matches<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a> and
prepared ourselves, concluding that we were near their
dwellings, but in the end we found it to be only a path
made to drive deer in, when the Indians hunt, as we supposed.</p>
<p>When we had marched five or six miles into the woods
and could find no signs of any people, we returned again
another way, and as we came into the plain ground we
found a place like a grave, but it was much bigger and
longer than any we had yet seen. It was also covered with
boards, so as we mused what it should be, and resolved to
dig it up, where we found, first a mat, and under that a
fair bow, and there another mat, and under that a board
about three quarters<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> long, finely carved and painted,
with three tines, or broaches, on the top, like a crown. Also
between the mats we found bowls, trays, dishes, and such
like trinkets. At length we came to a fair new mat, and
under that two bundles, the one bigger, the other less. We
opened the greater and found in it a great quantity of fine
and perfect red powder, and in it the bones and skull of a
man. The skull had fine yellow hair still on it, and some
of the flesh unconsumed; there was bound up with it a knife,
a packneedle,<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> and two or three old iron things. It was
bound up in a sailor&rsquo;s canvas cassock, and a pair of cloth
breeches. The red powder was a kind of embalment, and
yielded a strong, but no offensive smell; it was as fine as
any flour. We opened the less bundle likewise, and found
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
of the same powder in it, and the bones and head of a
little child. About the legs and other parts of it was bound
strings and bracelets of fine white beads; there was also
by it a little bow, about three quarters long, and some
other odd knacks. We brought sundry of the prettiest
things away with us, and covered the corpse up again.
After this, we digged in sundry like places, but found no
more corn, nor any thing else but graves.</p>
<p>There was variety of opinions amongst us about the embalmed
person. Some thought it was an Indian lord and
king. Others said the Indians have all black hair, and never
any was seen with brown or yellow hair. Some thought it
was a Christian of some special note, which had died
amongst them, and they thus buried him to honor him.
Others thought they had killed him, and did it in triumph
over him.</p>
<p>Whilst we were thus ranging and searching, two of the
sailors, which were newly come on the shore, by chance
espied two houses which had been lately dwelt in, but the
people were gone. They, having their pieces and hearing
nobody, entered the houses and took out some things, and
durst not stay but came again and told us. So some seven
or eight of us went with them, and found how we had
gone within a flight shot of them before. The houses were
made with long young sapling trees, bended and both ends
stuck into the ground. They were made round, like unto
an arbor, and covered down to the ground with thick and
well wrought mats, and the door was not over a yard high,
made of a mat to open. The chimney was a wide open
hole in the top, for which they had a mat to cover it close
when they pleased. One might stand and go upright in
them. In the midst of them were four little trunches<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a>
knocked into the ground, and small sticks laid over, on
which they hung their pots, and what they had to seethe.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
Round about the fire they lay on mats, which are their beds.
The houses were double matted, for as they were matted
without, so were they within, with newer and fairer mats. In
the houses we found wooden bowls, trays and dishes, earthen
pots, handbaskets made of crabshells wrought together,
also an English pail or bucket; it wanted a bail, but it had
two iron ears. There was also baskets of sundry sorts, bigger
and some lesser, finer and some coarser; some were curiously
wrought with black and white in pretty works, and sundry
other of their household stuff. We found also two or three
deer&rsquo;s heads, one whereof had been newly killed, for it
was still fresh. There was also a company of deer&rsquo;s feet
stuck up in the houses, harts&rsquo; horns, and eagles&rsquo; claws, and
sundry such like things there was, also two or three baskets
full of parched acorns, pieces of fish, and a piece of a broiled
herring. We found also a little silk grass, and a little tobacco
seed, with some other seeds which we knew not.
Without was sundry bundles of flags, and sedge, bulrushes,
and other stuff to make mats. There was thrust into a
hollow tree two or three pieces of venison, but we thought
it fitter for the dogs than for us. Some of the best things
we took away with us, and left the houses standing still as
they were.</p>
<p>So it growing towards night, and the tide almost spent,
we hasted with our things down to the shallop, and got
aboard that night, intending to have brought some beads
and other things to have left in the houses, in sign of peace
and that we meant to truck with them, but it was not
done, by means of our hasty coming away from Cape Cod.
But so soon as we can meet conveniently with them, we
will give them full satisfaction. Thus much of our second
discovery.</p>
<p>Having thus discovered this place, it was controversial
amongst us what to do touching our abode and settling
there; some thought it best, for many reasons, to abide there.
As first, that there was a convenient harbor for boats,
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
though not for ships. Secondly, good corn-ground ready
to our hands, as we saw by experience in the goodly corn
it yielded, which would again agree with the ground, and
be natural seed for the same. Thirdly, Cape Cod was like
to be a place of good fishing, for we saw daily great whales
of the best kind for oil and bone, come close aboard our
ship, and in fair weather swim and play about us. There
was once one, when the sun shone warm, came and lay
above water as if she had been dead, for a good while together,
within half a musket shot of the ship, at which two
were prepared to shoot to see whether she would stir or no.
He that gave fire first, his musket flew in pieces, both stock
and barrel, yet, thanks be to God, neither he nor any man
else was hurt with it, though many were there about. But
when the whale saw her time, she gave a snuff, and away.
Fourthly, the place was likely to be healthful, secure, and
defensible.</p>
<p>But the last and especial reason was, that now the heart
of winter and unseasonable weather was come upon us, so
that we could not go upon coasting and discovery without
danger of losing men and boat, upon which would follow
the overthrow of all, especially considering what variable
winds and sudden storms do there arise. Also, cold and
wet lodging had so tainted our people, for scarce any of us
were free from vehement coughs, as if they should continue
long in that estate it would endanger the lives of many,
and breed diseases and infection amongst us. Again, we
had yet some beer, butter, flesh, and other such victuals
left, which would quickly be all gone, and then we should
have nothing to comfort us in the great labor and toil we
were like to undergo at the first. It was also conceived,
whilst we had competent victuals, that the ship would stay
with us, but when that grew low, they would be gone and
let us shift as we could.</p>
<p>Others again, urged greatly the going to Anguum, or
Angoum,<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a> a place twenty leagues off to the northwards,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
which they had heard to be an excellent harbor for ships,
better ground, and better fishing. Secondly, for anything
we knew, there might be hard by us a far better seat, and
it should be a great hindrance to seat where we should remove
again. Thirdly, the water was but in ponds, and it
was thought there would be none in summer, or very little.
Fourthly, the water there must be fetched up a steep hill.
But to omit many reasons and replies used hereabouts, it
was in the end concluded to make some discovery within
the bay, but in no case so far as Anguum. Besides, Robert
Coppin, our pilot, made relation of a great navigable river
and good harbor in the other headland of this bay, almost
right over against Cape Cod, being in a right line not much
above eight leagues distant, in which he had been once;
and because that one of the wild men with whom they had
some trucking stole a harping iron<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a> from them, they
called it Thievish Harbor. And beyond that place they
were enjoined not to go, whereupon, a company was
chosen to go out upon a third discovery. Whilst some were
employed in this discovery, it pleased God that Mistress
White was brought a-bed of a son, which was called Peregrine.</p>
<p>The 5th day, we, through God&rsquo;s mercy, escaped a great
danger by the foolishness of a boy, one of Francis Billington&rsquo;s
sons, who, in his father&rsquo;s absence, had got gunpowder
and had shot of a piece or two, and made squibs, and there
being a fowling-piece charged in his father&rsquo;s cabin, shot
her off in the cabin; there being a little barrel of powder
half full, scattered in and about the cabin, the fire being
within four feet of the bed between the decks, and many
flints and iron things about the cabin, and many people
about the fire, and yet, by God&rsquo;s mercy, no harm done.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 6th of December, it was resolved our
discoverers should set forth, for the day before was too foul
weather, and so they did, though it was well o&rsquo;er the day
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
ere all things could be ready. So ten of our men were appointed
who were of themselves willing to undertake it,
to wit, Captain Standish, Master Carver, William Bradford,
Edward Winslow, John Tilley, Edward Tilley, John
Howland, and three of London, Richard Warren, Stephen
Hopkins, and Edward Dotte, and two of our seamen, John
Allerton and Thomas English. Of the ship&rsquo;s company
there went two of the master&rsquo;s mates, Master Clarke and
Master Coppin, the master gunner, and three sailors. The
narration of which discovery follows, penned by one of
the company.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 6th of December, we set out, being very
cold and hard weather. We were a long while after we
launched from the ship before we could get clear of a sandy
point which lay within less than a furlong of the same. In
which time two were very sick, and Edward Tilley had
like to have sounded<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a> with cold; the gunner also was sick
unto death, (but hope of trucking made him to go), and
so remained all that day and the next night. At length we
got clear of the sandy point and got up our sails, and within
an hour or two we got under the weather shore, and then
had smoother water and better sailing, but it was very cold,
for the water froze on our clothes and made them many
times like coats of iron. We sailed six or seven leagues by
the shore, but saw neither river nor creek; at length we
met with a tongue of land, being flat off from the shore,
with a sandy point. We bore up to gain the point, and
found there a fair income or road of a bay, being a league
over at the narrowest, and some two or three in length,
but we made right over to the land before us, and left the
discovery of this income till the next day. As we drew near
to the shore, we espied some ten or twelve Indians very
busy about a black thing&mdash;what it was we could not tell&mdash;till
afterwards they saw us, and ran to and fro as if they
had been carrying something away. We landed a league or
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
two from them, and had much ado to put ashore anywhere,
it lay so full of flat sands. When we came to shore, we made
us a barricade, and got firewood, and set out our sentinels,
and betook us to our lodging, such as it was. We saw the
smoke of the fire which the savages made that night, about
four or five miles from us.</p>
<p>In the morning we divided our company, some eight in
the shallop, and the rest on the shore went to discover this
place, but we found it only to be a bay, without either
river or creek coming into it. Yet we deemed it to be as
good a harbor as Cape Cod, for they that sounded it found a
ship might ride in five fathom water. We on the land
found it to be a level soil, though none of the fruitfullest.
We saw two becks<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a> of fresh water, which were the first
running streams that we saw in the country, but one might
stride over them. We found also a great fish, called a
grampus, dead on the sands; they in the shallop found two
of them also in the bottom of the bay, dead in like sort.
They were cast up at high water, and could not get off
for the frost and ice. They were some five or six paces
long, and about two inches thick of fat, and fleshed like a
swine; they would have yielded a great deal of oil if there
had been time and means to have taken it. So we finding
nothing for our turn, both we and our shallop returned.</p>
<p>We then directed our course along the sea sands, to the
place where we first saw the Indians. When we were
there, we saw it was also a grampus which they were cutting
up; they cut it into long rands or pieces, about an ell<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a>
long, and two handfull broad. We found here and there
a piece scattered by the way, as it seemed, for haste. This
place the most were minded we should call the Grampus
Bay, because we found so many of them there. We followed
the track of the Indians&rsquo; bare feet a good way on the
sands; at length we saw where they struck into the woods
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
by the side of a pond. As we went to view the place, one
said he thought he saw an Indian house among the trees,
so went up to see. And here we and the shallop lost sight
one of another till night, it being now about nine or ten
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>So we light on a path, but saw no house, and followed a
great way into the woods. At length we found where corn
had been set, but not that year. Anon we found a great
burying place, one part whereof was encompassed with a
large palisade, like a churchyard, with young spires<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> four
or five yards long, set as close one by another as they could,
two or three feet in the ground. Within it was full of
graves, some bigger and some less; some were also paled
about, and others had like an Indian house made over them,
but not matted. Those graves were more sumptuous than
those at Cornhill, yet we digged none of them up, but only
viewed them, and went our way. Without the palisade
were graves also, but not so costly. From this place we went
and found more corn-ground, but not of this year. As we
ranged we light on four or five Indian houses, which had
been lately dwelt in, but they were uncovered, and had no
mats about them, else they were like those we found at
Cornhill but had not been so lately dwelt in. There was
nothing left but two or three pieces of old mats, and a little
sedge. Also, a little further we found two baskets full of
parched acorns hid in the ground, which we supposed had
been corn when we began to dig the same; we cast earth
thereon again and went our way. All this while we saw
no people.</p>
<p>We went ranging up and down till the sun began to
draw low, and then we hasted out of the woods, that we
might come to our shallop, which when we were out of
the woods, we espied a great way off, and called them to
come unto us, the which they did as soon as they could, for
it was not yet high water. They were exceeding glad to
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
see us (for they feared because they had not seen us in so
long a time), thinking we would have kept by the shore
side. So being both weary and faint, for we had eaten
nothing all that day, we fell to make our rendezvous and
get firewood, which always costs us a great deal of labor.
By that time we had done, and our shallop come to us, it
was within night, and we fed upon such victuals as we had,
and betook us to our rest, after we had set out our watch.
About midnight we heard a great and hideous cry, and
our sentinels called, &ldquo;Arm! Arm!&rdquo; So we bestirred ourselves
and shot off a couple of muskets, and the noise ceased;
we concluded that it was a company of wolves or foxes, for
one told us he had heard such a noise in Newfoundland.</p>
<p>About five o&rsquo;clock in the morning we began to be stirring,
and two or three which doubted whether their pieces would
go off or no made trial of them, and shot them off, but
thought nothing at all. After prayer we prepared ourselves
for breakfast and for a journey, and it being now the
twilight in the morning, it was thought meet to carry the
things down to the shallop. Some said it was not best to
carry the armor down; others said they would be readier;
two or three said they would not carry theirs till they went
themselves, but mistrusting nothing at all. As it fell out,
the water not being high enough, they laid the things down
upon the shore and came up to breakfast. Anon, all upon a
sudden, we heard a great and strange cry, which we knew
to be the same voices, though they varied their notes. One
of our company, being abroad, came running in and cried,
&ldquo;They are men! Indians! Indians!&rdquo; and withal, their
arrows came flying amongst us.
<span class="inside">Our first combat with the <i>Indians</i>.</span>
Our men ran out with all
speed to recover their arms, as by the good providence of
God they did. In the meantime, Captain Miles Standish,
having a snaphance<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a> ready, made a shot, and after him
another. After they two had shot, other two of us were
ready, but he wished us not to shoot till we could take aim,
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
for we knew not what need we should have, and there were
four only of us which had their arms there ready, and stood
before the open side of our barricade, which was first assaulted.
They thought it best to defend it, lest the enemy
should take it and our stuff, and so have the more vantage
against us. Our care was no less for the shallop, but we
hoped all the rest would defend it; we called unto them to
know how it was with them, and they answered, &ldquo;Well!
Well!&rdquo; every one and, &ldquo;Be of good courage!&rdquo; We heard
three of their pieces go off, and the rest called for a firebrand
to light their matches. One took a log out of the
fire on his shoulder and went and carried it unto them,
which was thought did not a little discourage our enemies.
The cry of our enemies was dreadful, especially when our
men ran out to recover their arms; their note was after this
manner, &ldquo;<i>Woach woach ha ha hach woach</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a> Our men
were no sooner come to their arms, but the enemy was
ready to assault them.</p>
<p>There was a lusty man and no whit less valiant, who
was thought to be their captain, stood behind a tree within
half a musket shot of us, and there let his arrows fly at us.
He was seen to shoot three arrows, which were all avoided,
for he at whom the first arrow was aimed, saw it, and
stooped down and it flew over him; the rest were avoided
also. He stood three shots of a musket. At length one took,
as he said, full aim at him, after which he gave an extraordinary
cry and away they went all. We followed them
about a quarter of a mile, but we left six to keep our shallop,
for we were careful of our business. Then we shouted
all together two several times, and shot off a couple of
muskets and so returned; this we did that they might see we
were not afraid of them nor discouraged.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Thus it pleased God to vanquish our enemies and give
us deliverance. By their noise we could not guess that they
were less than thirty or forty, though some thought that
they were many more. Yet in the dark of the morning we
could not so well discern them among the trees, as they
could see us by our fireside. We took up eighteen of their
arrows which we have sent to England by Master Jones,
some whereof were headed with brass, others with harts&rsquo;
horn, and others with eagles&rsquo; claws. Many more no doubt
were shot, for these we found were almost covered with
leaves; yet, by the especial providence of God, none of
them either hit or hurt us though many came close by us
and on every side of us, and some coats which hung up in our
baricade were shot through and through.</p>
<p>So after we had given God thanks for our deliverance,
we took our shallop and went on our journey, and called
this place, The First Encounter. From thence we intended
to have sailed to the aforesaid Thievish Harbor, if we
found no convenient harbor by the way. Having the wind
good, we sailed all that day along the coast about fifteen
leagues, but saw neither river nor creek to put into. After
we had sailed an hour or two, it began to snow and rain,
and to be bad weather. About the midst of the afternoon,
the wind increased and the seas began to be very rough,
and the hinges of the rudder broke so that we could steer
no longer with it, but two men with much ado were fain
to serve with a couple of oars. The seas were grown so
great that we were much troubled and in great danger, and
night grew on. Anon Master Coppin bade us be of good
cheer; he saw the harbor. As we drew near, the gale being
stiff and we bearing great sail to get in, split our mast in
three pieces, and were like to have cast away our shallop.
Yet, by God&rsquo;s mercy, recovering ourselves, we had the flood
with us, and struck into the harbor.</p>
<p>Now he that thought that had been the place was deceived,
it being a place where not any of us had been before,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
and coming into the harbor, he that was our pilot did
bear up northward, which if we had continued we had been
cast away. Yet still the Lord kept us, and we bore up for an
island before us, and recovering of that island, being compassed
about with many rocks, and dark night growing upon
us, it pleased the Divine Providence that we fell upon a
place of sandy ground, where our shallop did ride safe and
secure all that night, and coming upon a strange island
kept our watch all night in the rain upon that island. And
in the morning we marched about it and found no inhabitants
at all, and here we made our rendezvous all that day,
being Saturday, 10th of December. On the Sabbath day
we rested, and on Monday we sounded the harbor, and
found it a very good harbor for our shipping. We marched
also into the land, and found divers cornfields, and little
running brooks, a place very good for situation, so we returned
to our ship again with good news to the rest of our
people, which did much comfort their hearts.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a></p>
<p>On the 15th day we weighed anchor, to go to the place
we had discovered, and coming within two leagues of the
land, we could not fetch the harbor, but were fain to put
room again towards Cape Cod, our course lying west, and
the wind was at northwest. But it pleased God that the
next day, being Saturday the 16th day, the wind came fair
and we put to sea again, and came safely into a safe harbor;
and within half an hour the wind changed, so as if we had
been letted<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> but a little, we had gone back to Cape Cod.</p>
<p>This harbor is a bay greater than Cape Cod, compassed
with a goodly land, and in the bay, two fine islands uninhabited,
wherein are nothing but wood, oaks, pines, walnuts,
beech, sassafras, vines, and other trees which we know
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
not. This bay is a most hopeful place, innumerable store of
fowl, and excellent good, and cannot but be of fish in their
seasons; skote,<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a> cod, turbot, and herring, we have tasted
of, abundance of mussels the greatest and best that ever we
saw; crabs and lobsters, in their time infinite. It is in
fashion like a sickle or fish-hook.</p>
<p>Monday the 18th day, we went a-land, manned with the
master of the ship and three or four of the sailors. We
marched along the coast in the woods some seven or eight
miles, but saw not an Indian nor an Indian house; only we
found where formerly had been some inhabitants, and where
they had planted their corn. We found not any navigable
river, but four or five small running brooks of very sweet
fresh water, that all run into the sea. The land for the
crust of the earth is, a spit&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a> depth, excellent black
mould,<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a> and fat<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a> in some places, two or three great oaks
but not very thick, pines, walnuts, beech, ash, birch, hazel,
holly, asp,<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a> sassafras in abundance, and vines everywhere,
cherry trees, plum trees, and many others which we know
not. Many kinds of herbs we found here in winter, as strawberry
leaves innumerable, sorrel, yarrow, carvel, brooklime,
liverwort, watercresses, great store of leeks and onions, and
an excellent strong kind of flax and hemp. Here is sand,
gravel, and excellent clay, no better in the world, excellent
for pots, and will wash like soap, and great store of stone,
though somewhat soft, and the best water that ever we
drank, and the brooks now begin to be full of fish. That
night, many being weary with marching, we went aboard
again.</p>
<p>The next morning, being Tuesday the 19th of December,
we went again to discover further; some went on land, and
some in the shallop. The land we found as the former day
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
we did, and we found a creek, and went up three English
miles. A very pleasant river, at full sea a bark of thirty
tons may go up, but at low water scarce our shallop could
pass. This place we had a great liking to plant in, but
that it was so far from our fishing, our principal profit,<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a>
and so encompassed with woods that we should be in much
danger of the savages, and our number being so little, and
so much ground to clear, so as we thought good to quit and
clear that place till we were of more strength. Some of us
having a good mind for safety to plant in the greater isle,<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a>
we crossed the bay which is there five or six miles over,
and found the isle about a mile and a half or two miles
about, all wooded, and no fresh water but two or three
pits, that we doubted of fresh water in summer, and so
full of wood as we could hardly clear so much as to serve
us for corn. Besides, we judged it cold for our corn, and
some part very rocky, yet divers thought of it as a place defensible,
and of great security.</p>
<p>That night we returned again a-shipboard, with resolution
the next morning to settle on some of those places; so
in the morning, after we had called on God for direction,
we came to this resolution: to go presently ashore again,
and to take a better view of two places, which we thought
most fitting for us, for we could not now take time for
further search or consideration, our victuals being much
spent, especially our beer, and it being now the 19th of
December. After our landing and viewing of the places,
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
so well as we could we came to a conclusion, by most voices,
to set on the mainland, on the first place, on a high ground,
where there is a great deal of land cleared, and hath been
planted with corn three or four years ago, and there is a
very sweet brook runs under the hill side, and many delicate
springs of as good water as can be drunk, and where we
may harbor our shallops and boats exceeding well, and in
this brook much good fish in their seasons; on the further
side of the river also much corn-ground cleared. In one
field is a great hill on which we point to make a platform
and plant our ordnance, which will command all round
about. From thence we may see into the bay, and far into
the sea, and we may see thence Cape Cod. Our greatest
labor will be fetching of our wood, which is half a quarter
of an English mile, but there is enough so far off. What
people inhabit here we yet know not, for as yet we have
seen none. So there we made our rendezvous, and a place
for some of our people, about twenty, resolving in the
morning to come all ashore and to build houses.</p>
<p>But the next morning, being Thursday the 21st of December,
it was stormy and wet, that we could not go ashore,
and those that remained there all night could do nothing,
but were wet, not having daylight enough to make them a
sufficient court of guard<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a> to keep them dry. All that night
it blew and rained extremely; it was so tempestuous that
the shallop could not go on land so soon as was meet, for
they had no victuals on land. About eleven o&rsquo;clock the
shallop went off with much ado with provision, but could
not return; it blew so strong and was such foul weather
that we were forced to let fall our anchor and ride with
three anchors ahead.</p>
<p>Friday, the 22nd, the storm still continued, that we could
not get a-land nor they come to us aboard. This morning
good-wife<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> Allerton was delivered of a son, but dead born.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Saturday, the 23rd, so many of us as could, went on
shore, felled and carried timber, to provide themselves stuff
for building.</p>
<p>Sunday, the 24th, our people on shore heard a cry of some
savages (as they thought) which caused an alarm, and to
stand on their guard, expecting an assault, but all was
quiet.</p>
<p>Monday, the 25th day, we went on shore, some to fell
timber, some to saw, some to rive, and some to carry, so no
man rested all that day. But towards night some, as they
were at work, heard a noise of some Indians, which caused
us all to go to our muskets, but we heard no further. So we
came aboard again, and left some twenty to keep the court
of guard. That night we had a sore storm of wind and rain.</p>
<p>Monday, the 25th day, we went on shore, some to fell
drink water aboard, but at night the master caused us to
have some beer, and so on board we had divers times now
and then some beer, but on shore none at all.</p>
<p>Tuesday, the 26th, it was foul weather, that we could
not go ashore.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 27th, we went to work again.</p>
<p>Thursday, the 28th of December, so many as could went
to work on the hill where we purposed to build our platform
for our ordnance, and which doth command all the
plain and the bay, and from whence we may see far into
the sea, and might be easier impaled, having two rows of
houses and a fair street. So in the afternoon we went to
measure out the grounds, and first we took notice how many
families there were, willing all single men that had no
wives to join with some family, as they thought fit, that
so we might build fewer houses, which was done, and we
reduced them to nineteen families. To greater families we
allotted larger plots, to every person half a pole in breadth,
and three in length,<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> and so lots were cast where every
man should lie, which was done, and staked out. We
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
thought this proportion was large enough at the first for
houses and gardens, to impale them round, considering the
weakness of our people, many of them growing ill with
cold, for our former discoveries in frost and storms, and
the wading at Cape Cod had brought much weakness
amongst us, which increased so every day more and more,
and after was the cause of many of their deaths.</p>
<p>Friday and Saturday, we fitted ourselves for our labor,
but our people on shore were much troubled and discouraged
with rain and wet, that day being very stormy and
cold. We saw great smokes of fire made by the Indians,
about six or seven miles from us, as we conjectured.</p>
<p>Monday, the 1st of January, we went betimes to work.
We were much hindered in lying so far off from the land,
and fain to go as the tide served, that we lost much time,
for our ship drew so much water<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> that she lay a mile and
almost a half off, though a ship of seventy or eighty tons
at high water may come to the shore.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 3rd of January, some of our people being
abroad to get and gather thatch, they saw great fires of
the Indians, and were at their corn-fields, yet saw none of
the savages, nor had seen any of them since we came to this
bay.</p>
<p>Thursday, the 4th of January, Captain Miles Standish
with four or five more, went to see if they could meet with
any of the savages in that place where the fires were made.
They went to some of their houses, but not lately inhabited,
yet could they not meet with any. As they came home, they
shot at an eagle and killed her, which was excellent meat;
it was hardly to be discerned from mutton.</p>
<p>Friday, the 5th of January, one of the sailors found alive
upon the shore a herring, which the master had to his supper,
which put us in hope of fish, but as yet we had got but
one cod; we wanted small hooks.</p>
<p>Saturday, the 6th of January, Master Martin was very
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
sick, and to our judgment no hope of life, so Master Carver
was sent for to come aboard to speak with him about his accounts,
who came the next morning.</p>
<p>Monday, the 8th day of January, was a very fair day,
and we went betimes to work. Master Jones sent the shallop,
as he had formerly done, to see where fish could be got.
They had a great storm at sea, and were in some danger;
at night they returned with three great seals and an excellent
good cod, which did assure us that we should have
plenty of fish shortly.</p>
<p>This day, Francis Billington, having the week before seen
from the top of a tree on a high hill a great sea as he
thought, went with one of the master&rsquo;s mates to see it. They
went three miles and then came to a great water, divided
into two great lakes, the bigger of them five or six miles in
circuit, and in it an isle of a cable length<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> square, the other
three miles in compass; in their estimation they are fine
fresh water, full of fish, and fowl. A brook issues from it;
it will be an excellent help for us in time. They found
seven or eight Indian houses, but not lately inhabited.
When they saw the houses they were in some fear, for they
were but two persons and one piece.</p>
<p>Tuesday, the 9th of January, was a reasonable fair day,
and we went to labor that day in the building of our town,
in two rows of houses for more safety. We divided by
lot the plot of ground whereon to build our town. After
the proportion formerly alloted, we agreed that every man
should build his own house, thinking by that course men
would make more haste than working in common. The
common house, in which for the first we made our rendezvous,
being near finished wanted only covering, it being
about twenty feet square. Some should make mortar, and
some gather thatch, so that in four days half of it was
thatched. Frost and foul weather hindered us much, this
time of the year seldom could we work half the week.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Thursday, the 11th, William Bradford being at work
(for it was a fair day) was vehemently taken with a grief
and pain, and so shot to his huckle-bone.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> It was doubted
that he would have instantly died; he got cold in the former
discoveries, especially the last, and felt some pain in his
ankles by times, but he grew a little better towards night
and in time, through God&rsquo;s mercy in the use of means, recovered.</p>
<p>Friday, the 12th, we went to work, but about noon it
began to rain that it forced us to give over work.</p>
<p>This day two of our people put us in great sorrow and
care; there was four sent to gather and cut thatch in the
morning, and two of them, John Goodman and Peter
Brown, having cut thatch all the forenoon, went to a
further place, and willed the other two to bind up that
which was cut and to follow them. So they did, being about
a mile and a half from our plantation. But when the two
came after, they could not find them, nor hear any thing
of them at all, though they hallooed and shouted as loud
as they could, so they returned to the company and told
them of it. Whereupon Master Leaver<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> and three or four
more went to seek them, but could hear nothing of them,
so they returning, sent more, but that night they could
hear nothing at all of them. The next day they armed ten
or twelve men out, verily thinking the Indians had surprised
them. They went seeking seven or eight miles, but
could neither see nor hear any thing at all, so they returned,
with much discomfort to us all.</p>
<p>These two that were missed, at dinner time took their
meat in their hands, and would go walk and refresh themselves.
So going a little off they find a lake of water, and
having a great mastiff bitch with them and a spaniel, by
the water side they found a great deer; the dogs chased
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
him, and they followed so far as they lost themselves and
could not find the way back. They wandered all that afternoon
being wet, and at night it did freeze and snow. They
were slenderly apparelled and had no weapons but each one
his sickle, nor any victuals. They ranged up and down
and could find none of the savages&rsquo; habitations. When it
drew to night they were much perplexed, for they could
find neither harbor nor meat, but, in frost and snow were
forced to make the earth their bed and the element their
covering. And another thing did very much terrify them;
they heard, as they thought, two lions roaring exceedingly
for a long time together, and a third, that they thought
was very near them. So not knowing what to do, they resolved
to climb up into a tree as their safest refuge, though
that would prove an intolerable cold lodging; so they stood
at the tree&rsquo;s root, that when the lions came they might take
their opportunity of climbing up. The bitch they were
fain to hold by the neck, for she would have been gone to
the lion; but it pleased God so to dispose, that the wild
beasts came not. So they walked up and down under the
tree all night; it was an extreme cold night. So soon as it
was light they travelled again, passing by many lakes and
brooks and woods, and in one place where the savages had
burnt the space of five miles in length, which is a fine
champaign<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> country, and even. In the afternoon, it pleased
God, from a high hill they discovered the two isles in the
bay, and so that night got to the plantation, being ready
to faint with travail and want of victuals, and almost famished
with cold. John Goodman was fain to have his shoes
cut off his feet they were so swelled with cold, and it was
a long while after ere he was able to go; those on the shore
were much comforted at their return, but they on shipboard
were grieved at deeming them lost.</p>
<p>But the next day, being the 14th of January, in the morning
about six of the clock the wind being very great, they
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
on shipboard spied their great new rendezvous on fire,
which was to them a new discomfort, fearing because of
the supposed loss of the men, that the savages had fired
them. Neither could they presently go to them, for want
of water, but after three quarters of an hour they went, as
they had purposed the day before to keep the Sabbath on
shore, because now there was the greater number of people.
At their landing they heard good tidings of the return of the
two men, and that the house was fired occasionally by a
spark that flew into the thatch, which instantly burnt it all up
but the roof stood and little hurt. The most loss was Master
Carver&rsquo;s and William Bradford&rsquo;s, who then lay sick in
bed, and if they had not risen with good speed, had been
blown up with powder, but, through God&rsquo;s mercy, they
had no harm. The house was as full of beds as they could
lie one by another, and their muskets charged, but, blessed
be God, there was no harm done.</p>
<p>Monday, the 15th day, it rained much all day, that they on
shipboard could not go on shore, nor they on shore do any
labor but were all wet.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, were very fair sunshiny
days, as if it had been in April, and our people, so many as
were in health, wrought cheerfully.</p>
<p>The 19th day we resolved to make a shed to put our
common provision in, of which some were already set on
shore, but at noon it rained, that we could not work. This
day in the evening, John Goodman went abroad to use
his lame feet, that were pitifully ill with the cold he had
got, having a little spaniel with him. A little way from
the plantation two great wolves ran after the dog; the dog
ran to him and betwixt his legs for succor. He had nothing
in his hand but took up a stick, and threw at one of them
and hit him, and they presently ran both away, but came
again; he got a pale-board<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a> in his hand, and they sat both
on their tails, grinning at him a good while, and went
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
their way and left him.</p>
<p>Saturday, 20th, we made up our shed for our common
goods.</p>
<p>Sunday, the 21st, we kept our meeting on land.</p>
<p>Monday, the 22nd, was a fair day. We wrought on our
houses, and in the afternoon carried up our hogsheads of
meal to our common storehouse. The rest of the week we
followed our business likewise.</p>
<p>Monday, the 29th, in the morning cold frost and sleet,
but after reasonable fair; both the long-boat and the shallop
brought our common goods on shore.</p>
<p>Tuesday and Wednesday, 30th and 31st of January, cold
frosty weather and sleet, that we could not work. In the
morning the master and others saw two savages that had
been on the island near our ship. What they came for we
could not tell; they were going so far back again before
they were descried, that we could not speak with them.</p>
<p>Sunday, the 4th of February, was very wet and rainy,
with the greatest gusts of wind that ever we had since we
came forth, that though we rid in a very good harbor, yet
we were in danger, because our ship was light, the goods
taken out, and she unballasted; and it caused much
daubing<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> of our houses to fall down.</p>
<p>Friday, the 9th, still the cold weather continued, that
we could do little work. That afternoon our little house
for our sick people was set on fire by a spark that kindled
in the roof, but no great harm was done. That evening, the
master going ashore, killed five geese, which he friendly
distributed among the sick people. He found also a good
deer killed; the savages had cut off the horns, and a wolf
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
was eating of him; how he came there we could not conceive.</p>
<p>Friday, the 16th, was a fair day, but the northerly wind
continued, which continued the frost. This day after noon
one of our people being a-fowling, and having taken a stand
by a creek-side in the reeds, about a mile and a half from
our plantation, there came by him twelve Indians marching
towards our plantation, and in the woods he heard the noise
of many more. He lay close till they were passed, and then
with what speed he could he went home and gave the
alarm, so the people abroad in the woods returned and armed
themselves, but saw none of them; only toward the
evening they made a great fire, about the place where they
were first discovered. Captain Miles Standish and Francis
Cook, being at work in the woods, coming home, left their
tools behind them, but before they returned their tools
were taken away by the savages. This coming of the savages
gave us occasion to keep more strict watch, and to
make our pieces and furniture ready, which by the moisture
and rain were out of temper.</p>
<p>Saturday, the 17th day, in the morning we called a meeting
for the establishing of military orders among ourselves,
and we chose Miles Standish our captain, and gave him
authority of command in affairs. And as we were in consultation
hereabouts, two savages presented themselves upon
the top of a hill, over against our plantation, about a
quarter of a mile and less, and made signs unto us to come
unto them; we likewise made signs unto them to come to
us, whereupon we armed ourselves, and stood ready, and
sent two over the brook towards them, to wit, Captain
Standish and Stephen Hopkins, who went towards them.
Only one of them had a musket, which they laid down on
the ground in their sight, in sign of peace, and to parley
with them, but the savages would not tarry their coming.
A noise of a great many more was heard behind the hill,
but no more came in sight. This caused us to plant our
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
great ordnances in places most convenient.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 21st of February, the master came on
shore with many of his sailors, and brought with him one
of the great pieces, called a minion,<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a> and helped us to
draw it up the hill, with another piece that lay on shore,
and mounted them, and a saller,<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a> and two bases.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> He
brought with him a very fat goose to eat with us, and we
had a fat crane, and a mallard, and a dried neat&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> tongue,
and so we were kindly and friendly together.</p>
<p>Saturday, the 3rd of March, the wind was south, the
morning misty, but towards noon warm and fair weather;
the birds sang in the woods most pleasantly. At one of the
clock it thundered, which was the first we heard in that
country; it was strong and great claps, but short, but after
an hour it rained very sadly<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> till midnight.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the 7th of March, the wind was full east,
cold, but fair. That day Master Carver with five others
went to the great ponds, which seem to be excellent fishing-places;
all the way they went they found it exceedingly
beaten and haunted with deer, but they saw none. Amongst
other fowl, they saw one a milk-white fowl, with a very
black head. This day some garden seeds were sown.</p>
<p>Friday, the 16th, a fair warm day towards; this morning
we determined to conclude of the military orders, which
we had begun to consider of before but were interrupted
by the savages, as we mentioned formerly. And whilst
we were busied hereabout, we were interrupted again, for
there presented himself a savage, which caused an alarm.
He very boldly came all alone and along the houses straight
to the rendezvous, where we intercepted him,<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> not suffering
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
him to go in, as undoubtedly he would, out of his boldness.
He saluted us in English, and bade us welcome, for
he had learned some broken English among the Englishmen
that came to fish at Monchiggon,<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> and knew by name
the most of the captains, commanders, and masters that
usually come. He was a man free in speech, so far as he
could express his mind, and of a seemly carriage. We
questioned him of many things; he was the first savage we
could meet withal. He said he was not of these parts, but
of Morattiggon,<a class="fn" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> and one of the sagamores or lords thereof,
and had been eight months in these parts, it lying hence
a day&rsquo;s sail with a great wind, and five days by land. He
discoursed of the whole country, and of every province,
and of their sagamores, and their number of men, and
strength. The wind beginning to rise a little, we cast a
horseman&rsquo;s coat about him, for he was stark naked, only
a leather about his waist, with a fringe about a span<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> long,
or little more; he had a bow and two arrows, the one headed,
and the other unheaded. He was a tall straight man,
the hair of his head black, long behind, only short before,
none on his face at all; he asked some beer, but we gave
him strong water<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> and biscuit, and butter, and cheese, and
pudding, and a piece of mallard, all which he liked well,
and had been acquainted with such amongst the English.
He told us the place where we now live is called Patuxet,
and that about four years ago all the inhabitants died of an
extraordinary plague,<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> and there is neither man, woman,
nor child remaining, as indeed we have found none, so as
there is none to hinder our possession, or to lay claim unto
it. All the afternoon we spent in communication with him;
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
we would gladly have been rid of him at night, but he was
not willing to go this night. Then we thought to carry
him on shipboard, wherewith he was well content, and
went into the shallop, but the wind was high and the
water scant, that it could not return back. We lodged him
that night at Stephen Hopkin&rsquo;s house, and watched him.</p>
<p>The next day he went away back to the Massasoits,<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a>
from whence he said he came, who are our next bordering
neighbors. They are sixty strong, as he saith. The Nausets
are as near southeast of them, and are a hundred strong,
and those were they of whom our people were encountered,
as we before related. They are much incensed and provoked
against the English, and about eight months ago
slew three Englishmen, and two more hardly escaped by
flight to Monchiggon; they were Sir Ferdinando Gorges
his men,<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a> as this savage told us, as he did likewise of the
<i>huggery</i>, that is, fight, that our discoverers had with the
Nausets, and of our tools that were taken out of the woods,
which we willed him should be brought again, otherwise, we
would right ourselves. These people are ill affected towards
the English, by reason of one Hunt,<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a> a master of a ship,
who deceived the people, and got them under color of
trucking with them, twenty out of this very place where
we inhabit, and seven men from the Nausets, and carried
them away, and sold them for slaves<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a> like a wretched
man (for twenty pound a man) that cares not what mischief
he doth for his profit.</p>
<p>Saturday, in the morning we dismissed the savage, and
gave him a knife, a bracelet, and a ring; he promised within
a night or two to come again, and to bring with him some
of the Massasoits, our neighbors, with such beavers&rsquo; skins
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
as they had to truck with us.</p>
<p>Saturday and Sunday, reasonable fair days. On this day
came again the savage, and brought with him five other
tall proper men; they had every man a deer&rsquo;s skin on him,
and the principal of them had a wild cat&rsquo;s skin, or such
like on the one arm. They had most of them long hosen<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a>
up to their groins, close made; and above their groins to
their waist another leather, they were altogether like the
Irish-trousers.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> They are of complexion like our English
gypsies, no hair or very little on their faces, on their heads
long hair to their shoulders, only cut before, some trussed
up before with a feather, broad-wise, like a fan, another a
fox tail hanging out. These left (according to our charge
given him before) their bows and arrows a quarter of a
mile from our town. We gave them entertainment as we
thought was fitting them; they did eat liberally of our
English victuals. They made semblance unto us of friendship
and amity; they sang and danced after their manner,
like antics.<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a> They brought with them in a thing like a
bow-case (which the principal of them had about his waist)
a little of their corn pounded to powder, which, put to a
little water, they eat. He had a little tobacco in a bag,
but none of them drank<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> but when he listed. Some of
them had their faces painted black, from the forehead to
the chin, four or five fingers broad; others after other
fashions, as they liked. They brought three or four skins,
but we would not truck with them at all that day, but wished
them to bring more, and we would truck for all, which
they promised within a night or two, and would leave these
behind them, though we were not willing they should, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
they brought us all our tools again which were taken in
the woods, in our men&rsquo;s absence. So because of the day we
dismissed them so soon as we could. But Samoset, our first
acquaintance, either was sick, or feigned himself so, and
would not go with them, and stayed with us till Wednesday
morning. Then we sent him to them, to know the reason
they came not according to their words, and we gave him a
hat, a pair of stockings and shoes, a shirt, and a piece of
cloth to tie about his waist.</p>
<p>The Sabbath day, when we sent them from us, we gave
every one of them some trifles, especially the principal of
them. We carried them along with our arms to the place
where they left their bows and arrows, whereat they were
amazed, and two of them began to slink away, but that the
other called them. When they took their arrows, we bade
them farewell, and they were glad, and so with many
thanks given us they departed, with promise they would
come again.</p>
<p>Monday and Tuesday proved fair days; we digged our
grounds, and sowed our garden seeds.</p>
<p>Wednesday a fine warm day, we sent away Samoset.</p>
<p>That day we had again a meeting to conclude of laws
and orders for ourselves, and to confirm those military
orders that were formerly propounded and twice broken
off by the savages&rsquo; coming, but so we were again the third
time, for after we had been an hour together on the top of the
hill over against us two or three savages presented themselves,
that made semblance of daring us, as we thought.
So Captain Standish with another, with their muskets
went over to them, with two of the master&rsquo;s mates that
follow them without arms, having two muskets with them.
They whetted and rubbed their arrows and strings, and
made show of defiance, but when our men drew near them,
they ran away; thus were we again interrupted by them.
This day with much ado we got our carpenter that had
been long sick of the scurvy, to fit our shallop, to fetch all
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
from aboard.</p>
<p>Thursday, the 22nd of March, was a very fair warm
day. About noon we met again about our public business,
but we had scarce been an hour together, but Samoset came
again, and Squanto, the only native of Patuxet, where we
now inhabit, who was one of the twenty captives that by
Hunt were carried away, and had been in England,<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a> and
dwelt in Cornhill with Master John Slanie, a merchant,
and could speak a little English, with three others, and they
brought with them some few skins to truck, and some red
herrings newly taken and dried, but not salted, and signified
unto us, that their great sagamore Massasoit was hard
by, with Quadequina his brother, and all their men. They
could not well express in English what they would, but
after an hour the king came to the top of a hill over against
us, and had in his train sixty men, that we could well behold
them and they us. We were not willing to send our
governor to them, and they unwilling to come to us, so
Squanto went again unto him, who brought word that we
should send one to parley with him, which we did, which
was Edward Winslow, to know his mind, and to signify
the mind and will of our governor, which was to have
trading and peace with him. We sent to the king a pair
of knives, and a copper chain with a jewel at it. To Quadequina
we sent likewise a knife and a jewel to hang in his
ear, and withal a pot of strong water, a good quantity of
biscuit, and some butter, which were all willingly accepted.</p>
<p>Our messenger made a speech unto him, that King James
saluted him with words of love and peace, and did accept
of him as his friend and ally, and that our governor desired
to see him and to truck with him, and to confirm a
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
peace with him, as his next neighbor. He liked well of the
speech and heard it attentively, though the interpreters
did not well express it. After he had eaten and drunk himself,
and given the rest to his company, he looked upon our
messenger&rsquo;s sword and armor which he had on, with intimation
of his desire to buy it, but on the other side, our
messenger showed his unwillingness to part with it. In the
end he left him in the custody of Quadequina his brother,
and came over the brook, and some twenty men following
him, leaving all their bows and arrows behind them. We
kept six or seven as hostages for our messenger; Captain
Standish and Master Williamson<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a> met the king at the
brook, with half a dozen musketeers. They saluted him
and he them, so one going over, the one on the one side, and
the other on the other, conducted him to a house then in
building, where we placed a green rug and three or four
cushions. Then instantly came our governor with drum
and trumpet after him, and some few musketeers. After
salutations, our governor kissing his hand, the king kissed
him, and so they sat down. The governor called for some
strong water, and drunk to him, and he drunk a great
draught that made him sweat all the while after; he called
for a little fresh meat, which the king did eat willingly,
and did give his followers. Then they treated of peace,
which was:</p>
<p class="sidenote">The agreements
of
peace
between
us and
Massasoit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. That neither he nor any of his should injure or do hurt
to any of our people.</p>
<p>2. And if any of his did hurt to any of ours, he should
send the offender, that we might punish him.</p>
<p>3. That if any of our tools were taken away when our
people were at work, he should cause them to be restored,
and if ours did any harm to any of his, we
would do the like to them.</p>
<p>4. If any did unjustly war against him, we would aid
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
him; if any did war against us, he should aid us.</p>
<p>5. He should send to his neighbor confederates, to certify
them of this, that they might not wrong us, but might
be likewise comprised in the conditions of peace.</p>
<p>6. That when their men came to us, they should leave
their bows and arrows behind them, as we should do
our pieces when we came to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, that doing thus, King James would esteem of him
as his friend and ally.</p>
<p>All which the king seemed to like well,<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a> and it was applauded
of his followers; all the while he sat by the governor
he trembled for fear. In his person he is a very
lusty man, in his best years, an able body, grave of countenance,
and spare of speech. In his attire little or nothing
differing from the rest of his followers, only in a great
chain of white bone beads about his neck, and at it behind
his neck hangs a little bag of tobacco, which he drank and
gave us to drink; his face was painted with a sad<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a> red like
murry,<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> and oiled both head and face, that he looked
greasily. All his followers likewise, were in their faces, in
part or in whole painted, some black, some red, some yellow,
and some white, some with crosses, and other antic works;
some had skins on them, and some naked, all strong, tall,
all men in appearance.</p>
<p>So after all was done, the governor conducted him to
the brook, and there they embraced each other and he departed;
we diligently keeping our hostages, we expected
our messenger&rsquo;s coming, but anon, word was brought us that
Quadequina was coming, and our messenger was stayed till
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
his return, who presently came and a troop with him, so
likewise we entertained him, and conveyed him to the place
prepared. He was very fearful of our pieces, and made
signs of dislike, that they should be carried away, whereupon
commandment was given they should be laid away.
He was a very proper tall young man, of a very modest and
seemly countenance, and he did kindly like of our entertainment,
so we conveyed him likewise as we did the
king, but divers of their people stayed still. When he was
returned, then they dismissed our messenger. Two of his
people would have stayed all night, but we would not
suffer it. One thing I forgot, the king had in his bosom,
hanging in a string, a great long knife; he marvelled much
at our trumpet, and some of his men would sound it as well
as they could. Samoset and Squanto, they stayed all night
with us, and the king and all his men lay all night in the
woods, not above half an English mile from us, and all
their wives and women with them. They said that within
eight or nine days they would come and set corn on the
other side of the brook, and dwell there all summer, which
is hard by us. That night we kept good watch, but there
was no appearance of danger.</p>
<p>The next morning divers of their people came over to us,
hoping to get some victuals as we imagined; some of them
told us the king would have some of us come see him. Captain
Standish and Isaac Allerton went venturously, who
were welcomed of him after their manner: he gave them
three or four ground-nuts, and some tobacco. We cannot
yet conceive but that he is willing to have peace with us,
for they have seen our people sometimes alone two or three
in the woods at work and fowling, when as they offered
them no harm as they might easily have done, and especially
because he hath a potent adversary the Narragansets, that
are at war with him, against whom he thinks we may be
some strength to him, for our pieces are terrible unto them.
This morning they stayed till ten or eleven of the clock, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
our governor bid them send the king&rsquo;s kettle, and filled it
full of pease, which pleased them well, and so they went
their way.</p>
<p>Friday was a very fair day; Samoset and Squanto still
remained with us. Squanto went at noon to fish for eels;
at night he came home with as many as he could well lift in
one hand, which our people were glad of. They were fat
and sweet; he trod them out with his feet, and so caught
them with his hands without any other instrument.</p>
<p>This day we proceeded on with our common business,
from which we had been so often hindered by the savages&rsquo;
coming, and concluding both of military orders and of some
laws and orders as we thought behooveful for our present
estate, and condition, and did likewise choose our governor
for this year, which was Master John Carver, a man
well approved amongst us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p09a.jpg" id="ncfig14" alt="illuminated capital" width="100" height="103" />
</div>
<p>It seemed good to the company for many
considerations to send some amongst
them to Massasoit, the greatest commander
amongst the savages bordering
upon us; partly to know where to find
them if occasion served, as also to see
their strength, discover the country, prevent
abuses in their disorderly coming unto us, make satisfaction
for some conceived injuries to be done on our
parts, and to continue the league of peace and friendship
between them and us. For these, and the like ends, it
pleased the governor to make choice of Stephen Hopkins and
Edward Winslow to go unto him, and having a fit opportunity,<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a>
by reason of a savage called Squanto (that
could speak English) coming unto us, with all expedition
provided a horseman&rsquo;s coat of red cotton, and laced with a
slight lace, for a present, that both they and their message
might be the more acceptable amongst them.</p>
<p>The message was as followeth: that forasmuch as his
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
subjects came often and without fear, upon all occasions
amongst us, so we were now come unto him, and in witness
of the love and good-will the English bear unto him, the
governor hath sent him a coat, desiring that the peace and
amity that was between them and us might be continued,
not that we feared them, but because we intended not to
injure any, desiring to live peaceably, and as with all men,
so especially with them, our nearest neighbors. But whereas
his people came very often, and very many together unto
us, bringing for the most part their wives and children with
them, they were welcome; yet we being but strangers as
yet at Patuxet, alias New Plymouth,<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a> and not knowing
how our corn might prosper, we could no longer give them
such entertainment as we had done, and as we desired still
to do. Yet if he would be pleased to come himself, or any
special friend of his desired to see us, coming from him they
should be welcome; and to the end we might know them
from others, our governor had sent him a copper chain,
desiring if any messenger should come from him to us, we
might know him by bringing it with him, and hearken and
give credit to his message accordingly. Also requesting
him that such as have skins should bring them to us, and
that he would hinder the multitude from oppressing us
with them. And whereas at our first arrival at Paomet
(called by us Cape Cod) we found there corn buried in
the ground, and finding no inhabitants but some graves of
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
dead new buried, took the corn, resolving if ever we could
hear of any that had right thereunto, to make satisfaction
to the full for it, yet since we understand the owners thereof
were fled for fear of us, our desire was either to pay them
with the like quantity of corn, English meal, or any other
commodities we had to pleasure them withal; requesting
him that some one of his men might signify so much unto
them, and we would content him for his pains. And last
of all, our governor requested one favor of him, which
was, that he would exchange some of their corn for seed
with us, that we might make trial which best agreed with
the soil where we live.</p>
<p>With these presents and message we set forward the 10th
June, about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, our guide resolving
that night to rest at Nemasket,<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a> a town under Massasoit,
and conceived by us to be very near, because the
inhabitants flocked so thick upon every slight occasion
amongst us; but we found it to be some fifteen English
miles. On the way we found some ten or twelve men,
women, and children, which had pestered us till we were
weary of them, perceiving that (as the manner of them all
is) where victual is easiest to be got, there they live, especially
in the summer: by reason whereof, our bay affording
many lobsters, they resort every spring-tide thither;
and now returned with us to Nemasket. Thither we came
about three o&rsquo;clock after noon, the inhabitants entertaining
us with joy, in the best manner they could, giving us a
kind of bread called by them <i>maizium</i>, and the spawn of
shads, which then they got in abundance, insomuch as they
gave us spoons to eat them. With these they boiled musty
acorns, but of the shads we ate heartily. After this they
desired one of our men to shoot at a crow, complaining
what damage they sustained in their corn by them, who
shooting some fourscore off and killing, they much admired
it, as other shots on other occasions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>After this, Squanto told us we should hardly in one
day reach Pokanoket,<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> moving us to go some eight miles
further, where we should find more store and better victuals
than there. Being willing to hasten our journey we went,
and came thither at sunsetting, where we found many of
the Namascheucks (they so calling the men of Nemasket)
fishing upon a weir which they had made on a river which
belonged to them, where they caught abundance of bass.
These welcomed us also, gave us of their fish, and we
them of our victuals, not doubting but we should have
enough where&rsquo;er we came. There we lodged in the open
fields, for houses they had none, though they spent the most
of the summer there. The head of this river is reported to
be not far from the place of our abode; upon it are and
have been many towns, it being a good length. The ground
is very good on both sides, it being for the most part cleared.
Thousands of men have lived there, which died in a great
plague not long since; and pity it was and is to see so
many goodly fields, and so well seated, without men to
dress and manure<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a> the same. Upon this river dwelleth
Massasoit. It cometh into the sea at the Narraganset Bay,
where the Frenchmen so much use. A ship may go many
miles up it, as the savages report, and a shallop to the head
of it; but so far as we saw, we are sure a shallop may.</p>
<p>But to return to our journey. The next morning we
broke our fast, took our leave and departed, being then accompanied
with some six savages. Having gone about
six miles by the river side, at a known shoal place, it being
low water, they spake to us to put off our breeches, for we
must wade through. Here let me not forget the valor and
courage of some of the savages on the opposite side of the
river, for there were remaining alive only two men, both
aged, especially the one being above threescore. These
two, espying a company of men entering the river, ran
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
very swiftly and low in the grass, to meet us at the bank,
where with shrill voices and great courage standing charged
upon us with their bows; they demanded what we were,
supposing us to be enemies, and thinking to take advantage
on us in the water. But seeing we were friends, they welcomed
us with such food as they had, and we bestowed a
small bracelet of beads on them. Thus far we are sure the
tide ebbs and flows.</p>
<p>Having here again refreshed ourselves we proceeded in
our journey, the weather being very hot for travel, yet the
country so well watered that a man could scarce be dry,
but he should have a spring at hand to cool his thirst, beside
small rivers in abundance. But the savages will not
willingly drink but at a springhead. When we came to any
small brook where no bridge was, two of them desired to
carry us through of their own accords, also fearing we
were or would be weary, offered to carry our pieces, also
if we would lay off any of our clothes, we should have
them carried; and as the one of them had found more
special kindness from one of the messengers, and the other
savage from the other so they showed their thankfulness
accordingly in affording us all help and furtherance in the
journey.</p>
<p>As we passed along, we observed that there were few
places by the river but had been inhabited, by reason whereof
much ground was clear, save of weeds which grew
higher than our heads. There is much good timber, both oak,
walnut tree, fir, beech, and exceeding great chestnut trees.
The country, in respect of the lying of it, is both champaign
and hilly, like many places in England. In some
places it is very rocky both above ground and in it. And
though the country be wild and overgrown with woods, yet
the trees stand not thick, but a man may well ride a horse
amongst them.</p>
<p>Passing on at length, one of the company, an Indian,
espied a man and told the rest of it. We asked them if
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
they feared any; they told us that if they were Narraganset
men they would not trust them. Whereat we called for our
pieces and bid them not to fear, for though they were
twenty, we two alone would not care for them. But they
hailing him, he proved a friend, and had only two women
with him; their baskets were empty but they fetched water
in their bottles, so that we drank with them and departed.
After, we met another man with other two women, which
had been at rendezvous by the salt water, and their baskets
were full of roasted crab, fishes, and other dried shell fish,
of which they gave us, and we ate and drank with them,
and gave each of the women a string of beads, and departed.</p>
<p>After, we came to a town of Massasoit&rsquo;s, where we ate
oysters and other fish. From thence we went to Pokanoket
but Massasoit was not at home; there we stayed, he being
sent for. When news was brought of his coming, our guide
Squanto requested that at our meeting we would discharge
our pieces. But one of us going about to charge his piece,
the women and children, through fear to see him take up
his piece, ran away, and could not be pacified till he laid
it down again, who afterward were better informed by our
interpreter.</p>
<p>Massasoit being come, we discharged our pieces, and
saluted him, who after their manner kindly welcomed us,
and took us into his house, and set us down by him, where,
having delivered our foresaid message and presents, and
having put the coat on his back and the chain about his
neck, he was not a little proud to behold himself, and his
men also to see their king so bravely<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a> attired.</p>
<p>For answer to our message, he told us we were welcome,
and he would gladly continue that peace and friendship
which was between him and us, and, for his men, they
should no more pester us as they had done; also that he
would sent to Paomet, and would help us with corn for
seed, according to our request.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>This being done, his men gathered near to him, to whom
he turned himself, and made a great speech; they sometimes
interposing, and, as it were, confirming and applauding him
in that he said. The meaning whereof was (as far as we
could learn) thus: Was not he Massasoit, commander of
the country about them? Was not such a town his, and
the people of it? And should they not bring their skins
unto us? To which they answered, they were his and would
be at peace with us, and bring their skins to us. After this
manner he named at least thirty places, and their answer
was as aforesaid to every one, so that as it was delightful,
it was tedious unto us.</p>
<p>This being ended, he lighted tobacco for us, and fell to
discoursing of England, and of the King&rsquo;s Majesty, marvelling
that he would live without a wife.<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> Also he talked
of the Frenchmen, bidding us not to suffer them to come to
Narraganset, for it was King James his country, and he
also was King James his man. Late it grew, but victuals
he offered none, for indeed he had not any, being he came
so newly home. So we desired to go to rest. He laid us on
the bed with himself and his wife, they at the one end and
we at the other, it being only planks laid a foot from the
ground, and a thin mat upon them. Two more of his chief
men, for want of room, pressed by and upon us, so that
we were worse weary of our lodging than of our journey.</p>
<p>The next day, being Thursday, many of their sachems, or
petty governors, came to see us, and many of their men also.
There they went to their manner of games for skins and
knives. There we challenged them to shoot with them for
skins, but they durst not; only they desired to see one of us
shoot at a mark, who shooting with hail-shot, they wondered
to see the mark so full of holes.</p>
<p>About one o&rsquo;clock, Massasoit brought two fishes that he
had shot; they were like bream but three times so big, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
better meat. These being boiled there were at least forty
looked for share in them, the most ate of them. This meal
only we had in two nights and a day, and had not one of
us bought a partridge we had taken our journey fasting.
Very importunate he was to have us stay with them longer.
But we desired to keep the Sabbath at home, and feared
we should either be light-headed for want of sleep, for what
with bad lodging, the savages&rsquo; barbarous singing (for they
use to sing themselves asleep), lice and fleas within doors,
and mosquitoes without, we could hardly sleep all the time
of our being there; we much fearing that if we should stay
any longer, we should not be able to recover home for want
of strength. So that on the Friday morning before sunrising,
we took our leave and departed, Massasoit being both
grieved and ashamed that he could no better entertain us,
and retaining Squanto to send from place to place to procure
truck for us, and appointing another, called Tokamahamon,
in his place, whom we had found faithful before
and after upon all occasions.</p>
<p>At this town of Massasoit&rsquo;s where we before ate, we
were again refreshed with a little fish, and bought about a
handful of meal of their parched corn, which was very
precious at that time of the year, and a small string of dried
shell-fish, as big as oysters. The latter we gave to the six
savages that accompanied us, keeping the meal for ourselves.
When we drank, we ate each a spoonful of it with a pipe
of tobacco, instead of other victuals, and of this also we
could not but give them so long as it lasted. Five miles
they led us to a house out of the way in hope of victuals,
but we found nobody there and so were but worse able to
return home. That night we reached to the weir where we
lay before, but the Namascheucks were returned, so that
we had no hope of any thing there. One of the savages
had shot a shad in the water, and a small squirrel as big
as a rat, called a <i>neuxis</i>; the one half of either he gave us,
and after went to the weir to fish. From hence we wrote to
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
Plymouth, and sent Tokamahamon before to Nemasket,
willing him from thence to send another, that he might
meet us with food at Nemasket. Two men now only remained
with us, and it pleased God to give them good store
of fish, so that we were well refreshed. After supper we
went to rest, and they to fishing again; more they got and
fell to eating afresh, and retained sufficient ready roast for
all our breakfasts. About two o&rsquo;clock in the morning
arose a great storm of wind, rain, lightning, and thunder,
in such violent manner that we could not keep in our fire,
and had the savages not roasted fish when we were asleep,
we had set forward fasting, for the rain still continued
with great violence, even the whole day through, till we
came within two miles of home.</p>
<p>Being wet and weary, at length we came to Nemasket;
there we refreshed ourselves, giving gifts to all such as had
showed us any kindness. Amongst others, one of the six
that came with us from Pokanoket, having before this on
the way unkindly foresaken us, marvelled we gave him
nothing, and told us what he had done for us. We also
told him of some discourtesies he offered us, whereby he
deserved nothing. Yet we gave him a small trifle, whereupon
he offered us tobacco; but the house being full of
people, we told them he stole some by the way, and if it
were of that we would not take it, for we would not receive
that which was stolen upon any terms; if we did,
our God would be angry with us, and destroy us. This
abashed him and gave the rest great content. But at our
departure he would needs carry him on his back through
a river, whom he had formerly in some sort abused. Fain
they would have had us to lodge there all night, and wondered
we would set forth again in such weather. But, God
be praised, we came safe home that night, though wet,
weary, and surbated.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a></p>

</div>
<p>The 11th of June we set forth, the weather
being very fair. But ere we had been
long at sea, there arose a storm of wind
and rain, with much lightning and
thunder, insomuch that a spout arose
not far from us, but, God be praised,
it dured not long, and we put in that
night for harbor at a place called Cummaquid,<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a> where we
had some hope to find the boy. Two savages were in the
boat with us, the one was Squanto, our interpreter, the
other Tokamahamon, a special friend. It being night before
we came in, we anchored in the midst of the bay, where
we were dry at alow water. In the morning we espied
savages seeking lobsters, and sent our two interpreters to
speak with them, the channel being between them; where
they told them what we were, and for what we were come,
willing them not at all to fear us, for we would not hurt
them. Their answer was, that the boy was well, but he
was at Nauset;<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a> yet since we were there they desired us to
come ashore and eat with them; which, as soon as our boat
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
floated, we did, and went six ashore, having four pledges for
them in the boat. They brought us to their sachem or governor,
whom they call Iyanough, a man not exceeding
twenty-six years of age, but very personable, gentle, courteous,
and fair conditioned, indeed not like a savage, save
for his attire. His entertainment was answerable to his
parts, and his cheer plentiful and various.</p>
<p>One thing was very grievous unto us at this place. There
was an old woman, whom we judged to be no less than a
hundred years old, which came to see us because she never
saw English, yet could not behold us without breaking forth
into great passion, weeping and crying excessively. We demanding
the reason of it, they told us she had three sons
who, when Master Hunt was in these parts, went aboard
his ship to trade with him, and he carried them captives
into Spain (for Squanto at that time was carried away
also) by which means she was deprived of the comfort of
her children in her old age. We told them we were sorry
that any Englishman should give them that offense, that
Hunt was a bad man, and that all the English that heard
of it condemned him for the same; but for us, we would
not offer them any such injury though it would gain us all
the skins in the country. So we gave her some small trifles,
which somewhat appeased her.</p>
<p>After dinner we took boat for Nauset, Iyanough and two
of his men accompanying us. Ere we came to Nauset, the
day and tide were almost spent, insomuch as we could not
go in with our shallop, but the sachem or governor of
Cummaquid went ashore and his men with him. We also
sent Squanto to tell Aspinet, the sachem of Nauset, wherefore
we came. The savages here came very thick amongst
us, and were earnest with us to bring in our boat. But we
neither well could, nor yet desired to do it, because we had
least cause to trust them, being they only had formerly
made an assault upon us in the same place, in time of our
winter discovery for habitation. And indeed it was no
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
marvel they did so, for howsoever, through snow or otherwise,
we saw no houses, yet we were in the midst of them.</p>
<p>When our boat was aground they came very thick, but
we stood therein upon our guard, not suffering any to enter
except two, the one being of Manomoyik,<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a> and one of those
whose corn we had formerly found; we promised him
restitution, and desired him either to come to Patuxet for
satisfaction, or else we would bring them so much corn
again. He promised to come; we used him very kindly for
the present. Some few skins we got there but not many.</p>
<p>After sunset, Aspinet came with a great train, and
brought the boy with him, one bearing him through the
water. He had not less than a hundred with him, the half
whereof came to the shallop side unarmed with him, the
other stood aloof with their bows and arrows. There he
delivered us the boy, behung with beads, and made peace
with us, we bestowing a knife on him, and likewise on
another that first entertained the boy and brought him
thither. So they departed from us.</p>
<p>Here we understood that the Narragansets had spoiled<a class="fn" id="fr_101" href="#fn_101">[101]</a>
some of Massasoit&rsquo;s men, and taken him. This struck some
fear in us, because the colony was so weakly guarded, the
strength thereof being abroad. But we set forth with resolution
to make the best haste home we could; yet the wind
being contrary, having scarce any fresh water left, and at
least sixteen leagues home, we put in again for the shore.
There we met again with Iyanough, the sachem of Cummaquid,
and the most of his town, both men, women, and
children with him. He, being still willing to gratify us,
took a runlet<a class="fn" id="fr_102" href="#fn_102">[102]</a> and led our men in the dark a great way
for water, but could find none good, yet brought such as
there was on his neck with him. In the meantime the
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
women joined hand in hand, singing and dancing before
the shallop, the men also showing all the kindness they
could, Iyanough himself taking a bracelet from about his
neck and hanging it upon one of us.</p>
<p>Again we set out, but to small purpose, for we gat but
little homeward.</p>
<p>Our water also was very brackish, and not to be drunk.
The next morning, Iyanough espied us again and ran after
us; we, being resolved to go to Cummaquid again to water,
took him into the shallop, whose entertainment was not
inferior unto the former.</p>
<p>The soil at Nauset and here is alike, even and sandy, not
so good for corn as where we are. Ships may safely ride in
either harbor. In the summer they abound with fish. Being
now watered we put forth again, and, by God&rsquo;s providence,
came safely home that night.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p11a.jpg" id="ncfig18" alt="illuminated capital" width="100" height="104" />
</div>
<p>At our return from Nauset, we found it true
that Massasoit was put from his country by
the Narragansets. Word also was brought
unto us that Corbitant, a petty sachem or
governor under Massasoit (whom they
ever feared to be too conversant with the
Narragansets), was at Nemasket, who sought to draw the
hearts of Massasoit&rsquo;s subjects from him, speaking also disdainfully
of us, storming at the peace between Nauset, Cummaquid,
and us, and at Squanto, the worker of it; also at
Tokamahamon, and one Hobomok (two Indians, or Lemes,<a class="fn" id="fr_103" href="#fn_103">[103]</a>
one of which he would treacherously have murdered a
little before, being a special and trusty man of Massasoit&rsquo;s).
Tokamahamon went to him, but the other two would not,
yet put their lives in their hands, privately went to see if
they could hear of their king, and lodging at Nemasket
were discovered to Corbitant, who set a guard to beset the
house, and took Squanto (for he had said, if he were dead
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the English had lost their tongue). Hobomok, seeing that
Squanto was taken, and Corbitant held a knife at his
breast, being a strong and stout man, broke from them and
came to New Plymouth, full of fear and sorrow for Squanto,
whom he thought to be slain.</p>
<p>Upon this news the company assembled together, and
resolved on the morrow to send ten men armed to Nemasket,
and Hobomok for their guide, to revenge the supposed
death of Squanto on Corbitant our bitter enemy, and to
retain Nepeof, another sachem or governor, who was of
this confederacy, till we heard what was become of our
friend Massasoit.</p>
<p>On the morrow we set out ten men armed, who took
their journey as aforesaid, but the day proved very wet.
When we supposed we were within three or four miles
of Nemasket, we went out of the way and stayed there
till night, because we would not be discovered. There we
consulted what to do, and thinking best to beset the house
at midnight, each was appointed his task by the captain, all
men encouraging one another to the utmost of their power.
By night our guide lost his way, which much discouraged our
men, being we were wet, and weary of our arms, but one
of our men, having been before at Nemasket, brought us
into the way again.</p>
<p>Before we came to the town, we sat down and ate such
as our knapsacks afforded. That being done, we threw
them aside, and all such things as might hinder us, and
so went on and beset the house, according to our last
resolution. Those that entered demanded if Corbitant
were not there, but fear had bereft the savages of speech.
We charged them not to stir, for if Corbitant were not
there, we would not meddle with them; if he were, we
came principally for him, to be avenged on him for the
supposed death of Squanto, and other matters; but, howsoever,
we would not at all hurt their women or children.
Notwithstanding, some of them pressed out at a private door
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
and escaped, but with some wounds. At length perceiving
our principal ends, they told us Corbitant was returned
with all his train, and that Squanto was yet living, and in
the town, offering some tobacco, other such as they had to
eat. In this hurly-burly we discharged two pieces at random,
which much terrified all the inhabitants, except
Squanto and Tokamahamon, who, though they knew not
our end in coming, yet assured them of our honesty, that
we would not hurt them. Those boys that were in the house,
seeing our care of women, often cried, &ldquo;<i>Neen squaes</i>,&rdquo; that
is to say, &ldquo;I am a woman&rdquo;; the women also hanging upon
Hobomok, calling him <i>Towam</i>, that is, &ldquo;friend.&rdquo; But to
be short, we kept them we had, and made them make a fire
that we might see to search the house. In the meantime
Hobomok got on the top of the house and called Squanto
and Tokamahamon, which came unto us accompanied with
others, some armed and others naked. Those that had
bows and arrows, we took them away, promising them
again when it was day. The house we took for our better
safeguard, but released those we had taken, manifesting
whom we came for and wherefore.</p>
<p>On the next morning we marched into the midst of the
town, and went to the house of Squanto to breakfast. Thither
came all whose hearts were upright towards us, but all
Corbitant&rsquo;s faction were fled away. There in the midst of
them we manifested again our intendment, assuring them,
that although Corbitant had now escaped us, yet there was
no place should secure him and his from us if he continued
his threatening us and provoking others against us, who
had kindly entertained him, and never intended evil towards
him till he now so justly deserved it. Moreover, if Massasoit
did not return in safety from Narraganset, or if
hereafter he should make any insurrection against him, or
offer violence to Squanto, Hobomok, or any of Massasoit&rsquo;s
subjects, we would revenge it upon him, to the overthrow
of him and his. As for those were wounded, we were sorry
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
for it, though themselves procured it in not staying in the
house at our command; yet if they would return home with
us, our surgeon should heal them.</p>
<p>At this offer, one man and a woman that were wounded
went home with us, Squanto and many other known friends
accompanying us, and offering all help that might be by
carriage of any thing we had to ease us. So that, by God&rsquo;s
good providence, we safely returned home the morrow
night after we set forth.</p>

<p>It seemed good to the company in general,
that though the Massachusets had often
threatened us (as we were informed), yet
we should go amongst them, partly to
see the country, partly to make peace
with them, and partly to procure their
truck. For these ends the governors
chose ten men fit for the purpose, and sent Squanto and
two other savages to bring us to speech with the people,
and interpret for us.</p>
<p>We set out about midnight,<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a> the tide then serving for us.
We supposing it to be nearer than it is, thought to be there
the next morning betimes, but it proved well near twenty
leagues from New Plymouth.</p>
<p>We came into the bottom of the bay,<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a> but being late we
anchored and lay in the shallop, not having seen any of
the people. The next morning we put in for the shore.
There we found many lobsters that had been gathered together
by the savages, which we made ready under a cliff.
The captain set two sentinels behind the cliff to the landward
to secure the shallop, and taking a guide with him and
four of our company, went to seek the inhabitants; where
they met a woman coming for her lobsters, they told her of
them, and contented her for them. She told them where
the people were. Squanto went to them; the rest returned,
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
having direction which way to bring the shallop to them.</p>
<p>The sachem or governor of this place, is called Obbatinewat,
and though he lives in the bottom of the Massachusetts
Bay, yet he is under Massasoit. He used us very kindly;
he told us he durst not then remain in any settled place,
for fear of the Tarentines.<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a> Also the Squaw Sachem,<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a> or
Massachusets&rsquo; queen, was an enemy to him.</p>
<p>We told him of divers sachems that had acknowledged
themselves to be King James his men, and if he also would
submit himself, we would be his safeguard from his enemies,
which he did, and went along with us to bring us to the
Squaw Sachem. Again we crossed the bay, which is very
large and hath at least fifty islands in it, but the certain
number is not known to the inhabitants. Night it was
before we came to that side of the bay where this people
were. On shore the savages went but found nobody. That
night also we rid at anchor aboard the shallop.</p>
<p>On the morrow we went ashore, all but two men, and
marched in arms up in the country. Having gone three
miles we came to a place where corn had been newly gathered,
a house pulled down, and the people gone. A mile from
hence, Nanepashemet, their king, in his life-time had lived.
His house was not like others, but a scaffold was largely
built, with poles and planks some six feet from ground,
and the house upon that, being situated on the top of a hill.</p>
<p>Not far from hence, in a bottom, we came to a fort built
by their deceased king, the manner thus: there were poles
some thirty or forty feet long, stuck in the ground as thick
as they could be set one by another, and with these they
enclosed a ring some forty of fifty feet over. A trench
breast high was digged on each side; one way there was to
go into it with a bridge; in the midst of this palisade stood
the frame of a house wherein, being dead, he lay buried.</p>
<p>About a mile from hence, we came to such another, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
seated on the top of a hill; here Nanepashemet was killed,
none dwelling in it since the time of his death. At this
place we stayed, and sent two savages to look the inhabitants,
and to inform them of our ends in coming, that they might
not be fearful of us. Within a mile of this place they found
the women of the place together, with their corn on heaps,
whither we supposed them to be fled for fear of us, and
the more, because in divers places they had newly pulled
down their houses, and for haste in one place had left some
of their corn covered with a mat, and nobody with it.</p>
<p>With much fear they entertained us at first, but seeing
our gentle carriage towards them, they took heart and
entertained us in the best manner they could, boiling cod and
such other things as they had for us. At length, with much
sending for, came one of their men, shaking and trembling
for fear. But when he saw we intended them no hurt,
but came to truck, he promised us his skins also. Of him
we inquired for their queen, but it seemed she was far
from thence&mdash;at least we could not see her.</p>
<p>Here Squanto would have had us rifle the savage women,
and taken their skins and all such things as might be
serviceable for us; for (said he) they are a bad people, and
have oft threatened you. But our answer was: Were they
never so bad, we would not wrong them, or give them any
just occasion against us; for their words, we little weighed
them, but if they once attempted any thing against us, then
we would deal far worse than he desired.</p>
<p>Having well spent the day, we returned to the shallop,
almost all the women accompanying us to truck, who sold
their coats from their backs, and tied boughs about them,
but with great shamefacedness (for indeed they are more
modest than some of our English women are). We promised
them to come again to them, and they us, to keep their
skins.</p>
<p>Within this bay the savages say there are two rivers,
the one whereof we saw, having a fair entrance, but we
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
had no time to discover it. Better harbors for shipping
cannot be than here are. At the entrance of the bay are
many rocks, and in all likelihood very good fishing-ground.
Many, yea, most of the islands have been inhabited, some
being cleared from end to end, but the people are all dead,
or removed.</p>
<p>Our victual growing scarce, the wind coming fair, and
having a light moon, we set out at evening and, through the
goodness of God, came safely home before noon the day
following.</p>

</div>
<p>Loving and Old Friend,<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a></p>
<p>Although I received no letter from you by this
ship,<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a>
yet forasmuch
as I know you expect
the performance of my promise,
which was, to write unto you
truly and faithfully of all
things, I have therefore at this
time sent unto you accordingly,
referring you for further satisfaction
to our more large relations.<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a></p>
<p>You shall understand that in this little time that a few
of us have been here, we have built seven dwelling-houses,
and four for the use of the plantation, and have made
preparation for divers others. We set the last spring some
twenty acres of Indian corn, and sowed some six acres of
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
barley and pease, and according to the manner of the
Indians, we manured our ground with herrings, or rather
shads, which we have in great abundance, and take with
great ease at our doors. Our corn did prove well, and,
God be praised, we had a good increase of Indian corn,
and our barley indifferent good, but our pease not worth the
gathering, for we feared they were too late sown. They
came up very well, and blossomed, but the sun parched
them in the blossom.</p>
<p>Our harvest being gotten in, our governor sent four men
on fowling, that so we might after a special manner rejoice
together after we had gathered the fruit of our labors.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a>
They four in one day killed as much fowl as, with a little
help beside, served the company almost a week. At which
time, amongst other recreations, we exercised our arms,
many of the Indians coming amongst us, and among the
rest their greatest king Massasoit, with some ninety men,
whom for three days we entertained and feasted, and they
went out and killed five deer, which they brought to the
plantation and bestowed on our governor, and upon the
captain and others. And although it be not always so plentiful
as it was at this time with us, yet by the goodness of
God, we are so far from want that we often wish you
partakers of our plenty.</p>
<p>We have found the Indians very faithful in their covenant
of peace with us, very loving and ready to pleasure
us. We often go to them, and they come to us; some of us
have been fifty miles by land in the country with them, the
occasions and relations whereof you shall understand by our
general and more full declaration of such things as are
worth the noting. Yea, it hath pleased God so to possess
the Indians with a fear of us, and love unto us, that not
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
only the greatest king amongst them, called Massasoit,
but also all the princes and peoples round about us, have
either made suit unto us, or been glad of any occasion to
make peace with us, so that seven of them at once have sent
their messengers to us to that end.<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a> Yea, an Fle<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a> at sea,
which we never saw, hath also, together with the former,
yielded willingly to be under the protection, and subjects
to our sovereign lord King James. So that there is now
great peace amongst the Indians themselves, which was not
formerly, neither would have been but for us; and we
for our parts walk as peaceably and safely in the wood as
in the highways in England. We entertain them familiarly
in our houses, and they as friendly bestowing their venison
on us. They are a people without any religion or knowledge
of any God, yet very trusty, quick of apprehension, ripe-witted,
just. The men and women go naked, only a skin about
their middles.</p>
<p>For the temper of the air, here it agreeth well with that
in England, and if there be any difference at all, this is
somewhat hotter in summer. Some think it to be colder in
winter, but I cannot out of experience so say; the air is
very clear and not foggy, as hath been reported. I never
in my life remember a more seasonable year than we have
here enjoyed, and if we have once but kine, horses, and sheep,
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
I make no question but men might live as contented here
as in any part of the world. For fish and fowl, we have
great abundance; fresh cod in the summer is but coarse
meat with us; our bay is full of lobsters all the summer and
affordeth variety of other fish; in September we can take
a hogshead of eels in a night, with small labor, and can
dig them out of their beds all the winter. We have mussels and
othus<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> at our doors. Oysters we have none near, but we can
have them brought by the Indians when we will; all the
spring-time the earth sendeth forth naturally very good sallet
herbs.<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a> Here are grapes, white and red, and very sweet
and strong also. Strawberries, gooseberries, raspas,<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a> etc.
Plums of three sorts, with black and red, being almost as
good as a damson; abundance of roses, white, red, and damask;
single, but very sweet indeed. The country wanteth
only industrious men to employ, for it would grieve your
hearts if, as I, you had seen so many miles together by
goodly rivers uninhabited, and withal, to consider those
parts of the world wherein you live to be even greatly
burdened with abundance of people. These things I
thought good to let you understand, being the truth of
things as near as I could experimentally take knowledge
of, and that you might on our behalf give God thanks who
hath dealt so favorably with us.</p>
<p>Our supply of men<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a> from you came the 9th of November
1621, putting in at Cape Cod, some eight or ten leagues
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
from us. The Indians that dwell thereabout were they who
were owners of the corn which we found in caves, for
which we have given them full content, and are in great
league with them. They sent us word there was a ship
near unto them, but thought it to be a Frenchman, and
indeed for ourselves, we expected not a friend so soon. But
when we perceived that she made for our bay, the governor
commanded a great piece to be shot off, to call home such
as were abroad at work; where-upon every man, yea, boy,
that could handle a gun, were ready, with full resolution
that if she were an enemy, we would stand in our just defense,
not fearing them, but God provided better for us
than we supposed. These came all in health, not any being
sick by the way (otherwise than by sea-sickness) and so
continue at this time, by the blessing of God; the good-wife
Ford was delivered of a son the first night she landed,
and both of them are very well.</p>
<p>When it pleaseth God, we are settled and fitted for the
fishing business, and other trading; I doubt not but by the
blessing of God the gain will give content to all. In the
mean time, that we have gotten we have sent by this ship,<a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a>
and though it be not much, yet it will witness for us that
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
we have not been idle, considering the smallness of our
number all this summer. We hope the merchants will accept
of it, and be encouraged to furnish us with things needful
for further employment, which will also encourage us to
put forth ourselves to the uttermost.</p>
<p>Now because I expect your coming unto us<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a> with other
of our friends, whose company we much desire, I thought
good to advertise<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a> you of a few things needful. Be careful
to have a very good bread-room to put your biscuits in. Let
your cask for beer and water be iron-bound for the first
tire if not more; let not your meat be dry-salted&mdash;none can
better do it than the sailors. Let your meal be so hard
trod in your cask that you shall need an adz or hatchet to
work it out with. Trust not too much on us for corn at
this time, for by reason of this last company that came,
depending wholly upon us, we shall have little enough till
harvest; be careful to come by some of your meal to spend
by the way&mdash;it will much refresh you. Build your cabins
as open as you can, and bring good store of clothes and bedding
with you. Bring every man a musket or fowling-piece;
let your piece be long in the barrel, and fear not the weight
of it, for most of our shooting is from stands. Bring juice
of lemons, and take it fasting; it is of good use. For hot
waters, aniseed water is the best, but use it sparingly. If
you bring any thing for comfort in the country, butter or
sallet oil, or both is very good. Our Indian corn, even
the coarsest, maketh as pleasant meat as rice, therefore spare
that unless to spend by the way; bring paper and linseed
oil for your windows, with cotton yarn for your lamps.
Let your shot be most for big fowls, and bring store of
powder and shot. I forbear further to write for the present,
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
hoping to see you by the next return, so I take my leave,
commending you to the Lord for a safe conduct unto us.
Resting in him,</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">Reasons and Considerations</span>
<br /><span class="smaller">touching the lawfulness of removing out of England into the parts of America.</span></h2>
<p class="sidenote">The Preamble</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" id="ncfig22" alt="illuminated capital" width="100" height="97" />
</div>
<p>Forasmuch as many exceptions are daily
made against the going into and inhabiting
of foreign desert places, to the hindrances of
plantations abroad, and the increase of distractions
at home, it is not amiss that some
which have been ear-witnesses of the exceptions
made, and are either agents or abettors of such
removals and plantations, do seek to give content to the
world, in all things that possibly they can.</p>
<p>And although the most of the opposites are such as
either dream of raising their fortunes here,<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a> to that than
which there is nothing more unlike, or such as affecting their
home-born country so vehemently, as that they had rather
with all their friends beg, yea, starve in it, than undergo a
little difficulty in seeking abroad; yet are there some who,
out of doubt in tenderness of conscience, and fear to offend
God by running before they be called, are straitened and
do straiten others from going to foreign plantations.</p>
<p>For whose cause especially, I have been drawn, out of
my good affection to them, to publish some reasons that
might give them content and satisfaction, and also stay and
stop the wilful and witty caviller; and herein I trust I
shall not be blamed of any godly wise, though through
my slender judgment I should miss the mark, and not strike
the nail on the head, considering it is the first attempt that
hath been made (that I know of) to defend those enterprises.
Reason would, therefore, that if any man of deeper
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
reach and better judgment see further or otherwise, that
he rather instruct me than deride me.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Cautions</p>
<p>And being studious for brevity, we must first consider
that whereas God of old did call and summon our fathers
by predictions, dreams, visions, and certain illuminations to
go from their countries, places, and habitations,
<span class="inside">Gen. 12:1, 2, &amp; 35:1.</span>
to reside
and dwell here or there, and to wander up and down
from city to city, and land to land, according to his will
and pleasure, now there is no such calling to be expected
for any matter whatsoever,
<span class="inside">Matt. 2:19.</span>
neither must any so much as
imagine that there will now be any such thing.
<span class="inside">Ps. 105:13.</span>
God did
once so train up his people, but now he doth not,
<span class="inside">Heb. 1:1, 2.</span>
but speaks
in another manner, and so we must apply ourselves to
God&rsquo;s present dealing, and not to his wonted dealing; and
as the miracle of giving manna
<span class="inside">Josh. 5:12.</span>
ceased when the fruits of
the land became plenty,
so God, having such a plentiful
storehouse of directions in his holy word, there must not
now any extraordinary revelations be expected. But now
the ordinary examples and precepts of the Scriptures,
reasonably and rightly understood and applied, must be
the voice and word that must call us, press us, and direct us
in every action.</p>
<p>Neither is there any land or possession now, like unto
the possession which the Jews had in Canaan,
<span class="inside">Gen. 17:8.</span>
being legally
holy and appropriated unto a holy people, the seed of
Abraham, in which they dwelt securely and had their days
prolonged, it being by an immediate voice said, that he
(the Lord) gave it them as a land of rest after their weary
travels, and a type of eternal rest in heaven but now there
is no land of that sanctimony, no land so appropriated, none
typical, much less any that can be said to be given of God
to any nation as was Canaan, which they and their seed
must dwell in, till God sendeth upon them sword or captivity.
But now we are all in all places strangers and
pilgrims, travellers and sojourners, most properly, having
no dwelling but in this earthen tabernacle; our dwelling
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
is but a wandering, and our abiding but as a fleeting, and
in a word our home is nowhere, but in the heavens,
<span class="inside">II Cor. 5:1, 2, 3.</span>
in that
house not made with hands, whose maker and builder is
God, and to which all ascend that love the coming of our
Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="sidenote">So were the
Jews, but yet
their temporal
blessings and
inheritances
were more
large than
ours.</p>
<p>Though then there may be reasons to persuade a man
to live in this or that land, yet there cannot be the same
reasons which the Jews had, but now as natural, civil and
religious bands tie men, so they must be bound, and as good
reasons for things terrene and heavenly appear, so they must
be led.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Object.</p>
<p>And so here falleth in our question, how a man
that is here born and bred, and hath lived some years, may
remove himself into another country.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Answ. 1.
What persons
may hence
remove.</p>
<p>I answer, a man must not respect only to live, and do
good to himself, but he should see where he can live to do
most good to others; for, as one saith, &ldquo;He whose living
is but for himself, it is time he were dead.&rdquo; Some men
there are who of necessity must here live, as being tied to
duties, either to church, commonwealth, household, kindred,
etc. But others, and that many, who do no good in none
of those, nor can do none, as being not able, or not in favor,
or as wanting opportunity, and live as outcasts, nobodies,
eye-sores, eating but for themselves, teaching but themselves,
and doing good to none, either in soul or body, and so pass
over days, years, and months, yea, so live and so die. Now
such should lift up their eyes and see whether there be not
some other place and country to which they may go to do
good and have use towards others of that knowledge, wisdom,
humanity, reason, strength, skill, faculty, etc., which
God hath given them for the service of others and his own
glory.</p>
<p class="sidenote">2.
Why they
should
remove.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Reas. 1</p>
<p>But not to pass the bounds of modesty so far as to name
any, though I confess I know many, who sit here still
<span class="inside">Luke 19:20.</span>
with their talent in a napkin,
having notable endowments both
of body and mind, and might do great good if they were in
some places, which here do none, nor can do none, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
yet through fleshly fear, niceness,<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a> straitness of heart, etc., sit
still and look on and will not hazard a dram of health, nor a
day of pleasure, nor an hour of rest to further the knowledge
and salvation of the sons of Adam in that New World,
where a drop of the knowledge of Christ is most precious,
which is here not set by. Now what shall we say to such
a profession of Christ, to which is joined no more denial
of a man&rsquo;s self?</p>
<p class="sidenote">Object.</p>
<p>But some will say, what right have I to go live in the
heathens&rsquo; country?</p>
<p class="sidenote">Answ.</p>
<p>Letting pass the ancient discoveries, contracts and agreements
which our Englishmen have long since made in
those parts, together with the acknowledgment of the
histories and chronicles of other nations, who profess the
land of America from the Cape de Florida unto the Bay
of Canada (which is south and north three hundred leagues
and upwards, and east and west further than yet hath been
discovered) is proper to the King of England&mdash;yet letting
that pass, lest I be thought to meddle further than it concerns
me, or further than I have discerning, I will mention
such things as are within my reach, knowledge, sight and
practise, since I have travailed in these affairs.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Reas. 2.</p>
<p>And first, seeing we daily pray for the conversion of the
heathens, we must consider whether there be not some
ordinary means and course for us to take to convert them,
or whether prayer for them be only referred to God&rsquo;s
extraordinary work from heaven. Now it seemeth unto
me that we ought also to endeavor and use the means to
convert them, and the means cannot be used unless we go
to them or they come to us; to us they cannot come, our
land is full; to them we may go, their land is empty.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Reas. 3.</p>
<p>This then is a sufficient reason to prove our going thither
to live lawful: their land is spacious and void, and there
are few and do but run over the grass, as do also the foxes
and wild beasts. They are not industrious, neither have
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
art, science, skill or faculty to use either the land or the
commodities of it, but all spoils, rots, and is marred for want
of manuring, gathering, ordering, etc. As the ancient patriarchs
therefore removed from straiter places into more
roomy, where the land lay idle and waste, and none used it,
though there dwelt inhabitants by them, (as Gen. 13:6,11,12,
and 34:21, and 41:20), so is it lawful now to take a
land which none useth, and make use of it.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Reas. 4.
This is to be
considered as
respecting
New England,
and the
territories
about the
plantation.</p>
<p>And as it is a common land or unused, and undressed
country, so we have it by common consent, composition
and agreement, which agreement is double. First, the imperial
governor Massasoit, whose circuits in likelihood are
larger than England and Scotland, hath acknowledged the
King&rsquo;s Majesty of England to be his master and commander,
and that once in my hearing, yea, and in writing,
under his hand to Captain Standish, both he and many
other kings which are under him, as Paomet, Nauset,
Cummaquid, Narraganset, Nemasket, etc., with divers
others that dwell about the bays of Patuxet and Massachusetts.
Neither hath this been accomplished by threats
and blows, or shaking of sword and sound of trumpet, for
as our faculty that way is small, and our strength less, so
our warring with them is after another manner, namely
by friendly usage, love, peace, honest and just carriages,
good counsel, etc., that so we and they may not only live
in peace in that land,
<span class="inside">Pss. 110:3, &amp; 48:3.</span>
and they yield subjection to an
earthly prince, but that as voluntaries they may be persuaded
at length to embrace the Prince of Peace, Christ
Jesus, and rest in peace with him forever.</p>
<p>Secondly, this composition is also more particular and
applicatory, as touching ourselves there inhabiting: the
emperor, by a joint consent, hath promised and appointed us
to live at peace where we will in all his dominions, taking
what place we will, and as much land as we will, and bringing
as many people as we will, and that for these two causes.
First, because we are the servants of James, King of England,
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
whose the land (as he confesseth) is; second, because
he hath found us just, honest, kind and peaceable,
and so loves our company; yea, and that in these things
there is no dissimulation on his part, nor fear of breach (except
our security engender in them some unthought of
treachery, or our uncivility provoke them to anger) is most
plain in other relations,<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a> which show that the things they
did were more out of love than out of fear.</p>
<p>It being then, first, a vast and empty chaos; secondly,
acknowledged the right of our sovereign king; thirdly, by
a peaceable composition in part possessed of divers of his
loving subjects, I see not who can doubt or call in question
the lawfulness of inhabiting or dwelling there, but that it
may be as lawful for such as are not tied upon some special
occasion here, to live there as well as here. Yea, and as
the enterprise is weighty and difficult, so the honor is more
worthy, to plant a rude wilderness, to enlarge the honor
and fame of our dread sovereign, but chiefly to display the
efficacy and power of the Gospel, both in zealous preaching,
professing, and wise walking under it, before the
faces of these poor blind infidels.</p>
<p>As for such as object the tediousness of the voyage
thither, the danger of pirates&rsquo; robbery, of the savages&rsquo;
treachery, etc., these are but lions in the way,
<span class="inside">Prov. 22:13.</span>
and it were
well for such men if they were in heaven, for who can
show them a place in this world where iniquity shall not
<span class="inside">Ps. 49:5.</span>
compass them at the heels,
and where they shall have a day
without grief, or a lease of life for a moment;
<span class="inside">Matt. 6:34.</span>
and who
can tell, but God, what dangers may lie at our doors,
even in our native country, or what plots may be abroad,
or when God will cause our sun to go down at noon-days,
and in the midst of our peace and security, lay upon us
<span class="inside">Amos 8:9.</span>
some lasting scourge for our so long neglect and contempt
of his most glorious Gospel?</p>
<p class="sidenote">Ob.</p>
<p>But we have here great peace, plenty of the Gospel, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
many sweet delights, and variety of comforts.</p>
<p class="sidenote">Answ.</p>
<p>True indeed, and far be it from us to deny and diminish
the least of these mercies, but have we rendered unto God
thankful obedience for this long peace, whilst other peoples
have been at wars?
<span class="inside">II Chron. 32:25.</span>
Have we not rather murmured, repined,
and fallen at wars amongst ourselves, whilst our peace hath
lasted with foreign power? Was there ever more suits in
law, more envy, contempt and reproach than nowadays?
Abraham and Lot departed asunder
<span class="inside">Gen. 13:9, 10.</span>
when there fell a
breach betwixt them, which was occasioned by the straitness
of the land; and surely, I am persuaded that howsoever
the frailties of men are principal in all contentions, yet
the straitness of the place is such as each man is fain to
pluck his means, as it were, out of his neighbor&rsquo;s throat;
there is such pressing and oppressing in town and country,
about farms, trades, traffic, etc., so as a man can hardly
any where set up a trade but he shall pull down two of
his neighbors.</p>
<p>The towns abound with young tradesmen, and the hospitals
are full of the ancient; the country is replenished with
new farmers, and the almshouses are filled with old laborers;
many there are who get their living with bearing burdens,
but more are fain to burden the land with their whole bodies.
Multitudes get their means of life by prating, and so do
numbers more by begging. Neither come these straits upon
men always through intemperance, ill husbandry, indiscretion,
etc., as some think, but even the most wise, sober,
and discreet men go often to the wall, when they have done
their best, wherein, as God&rsquo;s providence swayeth all, so
it is easy to see that the straitness of the place, having in it
so many strait hearts, cannot but produce such effects more
and more, so as every indifferent minded man should be
ready to say with father Abraham, &ldquo;Take thou the right
hand, and I will take the left.&rdquo; Let us not thus oppress,
straiten, and afflict one another, but seeing there is a
spacious land, the way to which is through the sea, we will
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
end this difference in a day.</p>
<p>That I speak nothing about the bitter contention that
hath been about religion, by writing, disputing, and inveighing
earnestly one against another, the heat of which
zeal, if it were turned against the rude barbarism of the
heathens, it might do more good in a day than it hath
done here in many years. Neither of the little love to the
Gospel, and profit which is made by the preachers in most
places, which might easily drive the zealous to the heathens
who, no doubt, if they had but a drop of that knowledge
which here flieth about the streets, would be filled with
exceeding great joy and gladness, as that they would even
pluck the kingdom of heaven by violence, and take it as it
were, by force.</p>
<p class="sidenote">The last let.</p>
<p>The greatest let<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a> that is yet behind is the sweet fellowship
of friends, and the satiety of bodily delights.</p>
<p>But can there be two nearer friends almost than Abraham
and Lot, or than Paul and Barnabas? And yet, upon as
little occasions as we have here, they departed asunder,
two of them being patriarchs of the church of old; the
other the apostles of the church which is new, and their
covenants were such as it seemeth might bind as much as any
covenant between men at this day, and yet to avoid greater
inconveniences they departed asunder.</p>
<p>Neither must men take so much thought for the flesh,
as not to be pleased except they can pamper their bodies
with variety of dainties. Nature is content with little, and
health is much endangered by mixtures upon the stomach.
The delights of the palate do often inflame the vital parts
as the tongue setteth afire the whole body.
<span class="inside">James 3:6.</span>
Secondly,
varieties here are not common to all, but many good men
are glad to snap at a crust. The rent-taker lives on sweet
morsels, but the rent-payer eats a dry crust often with
watery eyes, and it is nothing to say what some one of a
hundred hath, but what the bulk, body and commonalty
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
hath, which I warrant you is short enough.</p>
<p>And they also which now live so sweetly, hardly will
their children attain to that privilege, but some circumventor
or other will outstrip them, and make them sit in
the dust, to which men are brought in one age, but cannot
get out of it again in seven generations.</p>
<p>To conclude, without all partiality, the present consumption
which groweth upon us here, whilst the land groaneth
under so many close-fisted and unmerciful men, being
compared with the easiness, plainness and plentifulness in
living in those remote places, may quickly persuade any
man to a liking of this course, and to practise a removal,
which being done by honest, godly and industrious men, they
shall there be right heartily welcome, but for other of
dissolute and profane life, their rooms are better than their
companies. For if here, where the Gospel hath been so
long and plentifully taught, they are yet frequent in such
vices as the heathen would shame to speak of, what will they
be when there is less restraint in word and deed? My only
suit to all men is, that whether they live there or here,
they would learn to use this world as they used it not,
keeping faith and a good conscience, both with God and
men, that when the day of account shall come, they may
come forth as good and fruitful servants, and freely be received,
and enter into the joy of their Master.</p>

5 August 1620, but because the <i>Speedwell</i> leaked dangerously
they put in at Dartmouth for repairs. When they returned to
the open sea, they discovered that she still shipped water.
Turning to the nearest port, they reluctantly decided to abandon
the <i>Speedwell</i> as unseaworthy, and many of the party
transferred to the already crowded <i>Mayflower</i>, while a few
decided to defer their emigration. The successful voyage from
Plymouth began 6 September, with their third departure from
the homeland.

They were delighted to receive this confirmation of their legal rights, and may have dedicated the book to him in gratitude.

had not come to unknown territory. This portion of the
coast had been sailed by Giovanni de Verrazzano as early as
1524; probably the first Englishman to visit the area was Bartholomew
Gosnold in 1602. In 1605, George Waymouth commanded
a voyage of exploration and trade, and kipnapped five
Indians in Maine, of whom one, Squanto, later befriended the
Pilgrims. By 1608, Samuel de Champlain had even charted
the <i>Port du Cap de St. Louis</i>, which was to become Plymouth
Harbor. Capt. John Smith&rsquo;s map of New England, prepared on
a voyage in 1614, already shows the site named &ldquo;Plimouth.&rdquo;
Apparently two mates (or pilots?) of the <i>Mayflower</i> had sailed
the coast previously.

have posed a real threat.

John Quincy Adams overstated the case when he said that
&ldquo;This is perhaps the only instance in human history of that
positive social compact which speculative philosophers have
imagined as the only legitimate source of government.&rdquo; As
evidenced in the signatures, the distinction between masters
and servants remained, and women had no legal voice but were
still chattel. Nevertheless, it is an unusual document in which
the concept of self-government emerges so sharply during a time
when the divine right of kings was assumed. It is clearly
modelled on the &ldquo;covenants&rdquo; or &ldquo;combinations&rdquo; which characterized
most Separatist congregations, and is presaged in Rev.
Robinson&rsquo;s farewell letter.

throughout Massasoit&rsquo;s life. He and his eldest son Wamsutta
(named &ldquo;Alexander&rdquo; by the English) signed such a treaty in
Plymouth in 1639, and it was ratified and confirmed by the
colonial government. The peace was broken in 1675, for which
most historians blame Wamsutta&rsquo;s brother and successor,
Metacom (&ldquo;King Philip&rdquo;).

During the preceding three months, which are unreported in
this journal, Bradford notes that almost half of the settlers died
in the &ldquo;General Sickness.&rdquo; None abandoned the enterprise, however,
and the <i>Mayflower</i> returned empty to England.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_91" href="#fr_91">[91]</a>The derivation of this name is not clear. Six different spellings
occur even within this book: <i>Plimoth, and New Plimoth</i> (both
on the title page!), <i>Plimouth</i>, <i>Plimmouth</i>, <i>New Plimmouth</i>, and
<i>New Plimmouth</i>. It is true that Plymouth was the town from
which the settlers had finally set sail from their native country,
&ldquo;... having been kindly entertained and courteously used by divers
friends there dwelling.&rdquo; Furthermore, the land company which
granted their patent had once been called the Plymouth Company.
But we need evoke neither sentimentalism nor commercial
diplomacy on the part of the Pilgrims to account for the name.
In fact, this site was called &ldquo;Plimouth&rdquo; on the map which they
carried on the <i>Mayflower</i>, from Capt. John Smith&rsquo;s <i>Description of
New England</i> (London, 1616); supposedly it was arbitrarily so
designated by Prince Charles when Smith showed him a draft of
the map.

<p class="pcap">THE MAYFLOWER</p>
<p class="pcapc">Weighing about 180 tons, and only about 106 feet long, the overcrowded
<i>Mayflower</i> must have had a rough voyage. The Pilgrims
sailed across the north Atlantic to avoid pirates who frequented
the more temperate latitudes. No one knows exactly what the
original <i>Mayflower</i> looked like, but this reconstruction of a typical
ship of the time and class is probably very similar.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<div class="img" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="774" />
<p class="pcap">THE SHALLOP</p>
<p class="pcapc">Small groups of Pilgrims explored Cape Cod and Clark&rsquo;s Island
before selecting Plymouth as the site for their settlement. They
plied between the <i>Mayflower</i> and the shore in a shallop, a large
open boat which could be rowed and/or fitted with sails.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="937" />
<p class="pcap">INDIAN WIGWAM</p>
<p class="pcapc">This reconstructed wigwam and its contents are like those
encountered by the Pilgrims during their first explorations. The
bark huts of their Algonquian Indian neighbors soon became
familiar shelters to the Pilgrims, whose descriptive accounts allow
us to understand much of the native way of life which fast disappeared
in New England.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p18.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1001" />
<p class="pcap">CONSTRUCTING A HOUSE AT PLYMOUTH</p>
<p class="pcapc">Members of the group early agreed that each family should build
its own house, &ldquo;... thinking by that course men would make more
haste.&rdquo; Roofs were thatched with bundles of rushes and grass, which
provided a good watershed but could easily be fired by a spark from
the chimney, as is graphically described in <i>Mourt&rsquo;s Relation</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p19.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="991" />
<p class="pcap">PILGRIM HOUSE IN WINTER</p>
<p class="pcapc">Pilgrim houses like this may have been almost as snug as log
cabins which were unknown in America until several years later.
Clapboards prepared by the Pilgrims also constituted a major
portion of the first shipment which was sent back to the sponsoring
&ldquo;merchant adventurers&rdquo; in England.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/p20.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="890" />
<p class="pcap">A PILGRIM FAMILY</p>
<p class="pcapc">Everyone had to work at securing food during the first difficult
years in the new plantation. Corn, pumpkin, and turkey came to
be major items in the diet of the Pilgrims after they learned their
uses from the Indians.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p21.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="888" />
<p class="pcap">THE FIRST THANKSGIVING</p>
<p class="pcapc">It must have been a festive occasion when, &ldquo;Our harvest being
gotten in, our governor sent four men on fowling, that so we might
after a special manner rejoice together, after we had gathered the
fruit of our labors.&rdquo; Massasoit and ninety other Indians were welcomed
and contributed five deer to the three-day harvest festival.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/p22.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="853" />
<p class="pcap">PILGRIMS GOING TO CHURCH</p>
<p class="pcapc">Most of the Pilgrims were Separatists who were opposed to the
forms of the Church of England, but spent most of the sabbath in
informal services combining social and religious activities. Fear
of Indian attack made the first settlers cautious, so they rarely
traveled unarmed, and in 1622-23 built a combined fort and meeting-house,
although they were fortunate in enjoying warm relations
with neighboring tribes for several years.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h3>PHOTOGRAPHS FROM PLIMOTH PLANTATION</h3>
<p>The preceding photographs illustrating modern reconstructions
of things familiar to the Pilgrims were generously provided by
Plimoth Plantation, in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The Plantation
includes full-scale replicas of the <i>Mayflower</i>, the shallop, and the
original settlement, much as they probably looked in 1627. During
that year the first census was recorded and the herd which had
been owned in common was divided. Records kept by administrators
of the colony tell where the various houses were located, how
much land was alloted to each household, and other relevant information.
Historical research in such documents has been supplemented
by archeological excavation to yield clues which allow plausible
reconstruction. With such full-scale exhibitions, and through
a continuing program of research and publication, this non-profit
organization attempts to foster better public understanding of the
adventure of the Pilgrims, which was first recounted in <i>Mourt&rsquo;s
Relation</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
